!! Timeline of the Warhammer World

Below is a timeline outlining a chronology of the major events that have transpired for all of the major factions in the history of the Warhammer World. The timeline lists general dates of major events according to the Imperial Calendar (IC). If a date is given in the source material according to a different calendar (such as the Nehekharan Calendar which dates Year 1 as the beginning of King Settra the Imperishable's second reign, the Book of Days of the Asur (High elves) which measures dates in the regal years of the Phoenix Kings or the Gospodarin Calendar which dates Year 2 as the founding of the city of Kislev) the dates are adjusted to the Imperial Calendar by matching them against the founding of the Empire of Man by Sigmar in the year 1 IC. The names of the various ages of creation are credited to the Lizardmen since they have the longest continual history of any intelligent race of the Warhammer World. Whenever the date of an event is unknown, but it is understood to have happened after the given year, it will be listed as a subset of the given year.

!!! Timeline

* C. -15000: The Old Ones arrive in the primeval and untouched lands of Lustria. The Slann of the First Spawning are created at the will of the Old Ones. The first Saurus are spawned as living weapons, created from a blend of now extinct native creatures. The first generations of Skinks and Kroxigor are created.
* (C. -10000 to -5600): Founding of the First City, Itza. Soon followed by the founding of Xlanhuapec and Tlax. The second generation of Slann are spawned. The orbit of the world is altered to affect weather patterns and temperature, making it more conducive to life. During this time, the Old Ones begin to enforce their domination over the inhabitants of the world, radically altering the future of these races. Slann of the Third Spawning are brought forth. They accomplish the founding of Tlaxtlan, Quetza and Zlatlan. Slann of the Fourth Spawning are created to attend to the polar warp gate. They also found the remaining temple-cities, creating a grid of power across the lands - natural lines of energy linking the cities. The super continent is split into separate, smaller lands. The World Pond is created, and the Southlands moved around the globe, separating the temple-cities. Such physical distances meant little, for travel and communication between the cities is instantaneous. The Old Ones send their armies of Saurus forth to lay down order. The annihilation of many undesirable races is accomplished. Ongoing experiments are conducted by the Old Ones, as they create and destroy a number of new races, altering them from native life forms. The Elves, Dwarfs and Men are born. The Old Ones ensure that their creations are secured a strong foundation in the lands chosen for them, to continue the slow process of evolution and the growth of civilization with only minimal interaction with each other. The race of Greenskins appears towards the end of the Age of Creation. There are continuing wars to try and eliminate this parasitic race from existence, though ultimately this plague seems to be impossible to eradicate.
* C. -10.000: Near the dawn of creation, the greenskins appear, although no one knows how. Shamans tell stones of Gork and Mork falling from the sky to populate the world with greenskins. The Old Ones recognise Orcs and Goblins as a threat and send the Saurus to war with them. They are unable to exterminate the undesirables.
* (C. -5600 to -4500): Collapse of the polar warp gates. This causes a rent in reality to be ripped open, allowing Chaos, to enter the world. This marks the departure of the Old Ones. Ogres are created to stop the spread of Chaos. Daemonic hordes appear and run rampant across the world, creating imbalance and horror. The temple-city of Xahutec is the first to fall under the daemonic onslaught, its Mage-Priests slain and spawning pools tainted. The Lizardmen muster the greatest armies ever witnessed in the world to repel the daemonic invaders. Countless millions are slain in these titanic battles. Throughout the world, the races formed by the Old Ones fight against the rampantly spreading Daemons, yet they are fighting a losing battle. The entire populations of Huatl, Tlanxla, Chaqua and Xhotl are also slain by the Daemons, each temple-city weakening as more cities fall, breaking their grid of connected power. Mage-Priest Adohi-Tehga of Tlaxtlan repels the Daemons besieging his temple-city after weeks of battle, and lends his power to protecting the remaining cities and ensuring that the grid of power does not collapse utterly. With the power of the Old Ones lost from the world, contact is lost with the Lizardmen of the Southlands. One of the oldest Mage-Priests, Chiccotta of Zlatlan, having been taught by the lost Old One Xholankha, manages to use his powers to destroy the daemonic legions within the Southlands in one catastrophic spell, sacrificing himself in the process. The Elves of Ulthuan are almost exterminated by daemons overrunning their isle. Their mages begin a dangerous and desperate spell to push the Daemons back. The Slann add their power to those of the Elves, and together they draw the Daemons to the north and south poles. Defences are put into place to hold the forces of Chaos at bay. The immediate threat of Chaos has been repelled, yet throughout the years, as their powers wax, they will overrun these defences in mighty incursions. The temple-city of Chupayotl starts to slip into the oceans of the World Pond.

* C. -4450: The Siege of Itza, which had lasted over four centuries, is broken by the eldritch might of Lord Kroak. Although slain in battle, Lord Kroak's will is so strong his spirit fights on — invoking a last spell that banishes Daemons and secures Itza from its doom.

The population of Skavenblight is devastated and the twelve Grey Lords arise, forming the first Council of Thirteen and the Order of the Grey Seers. The Great Machine of the Seer Order explodes. The Slann, ignorant of the newly emerged race, registered the energy and attributed it solely to their own powerful spells. To this day they have failed to make any connection. The Great Migration out of Skavenblight begins. Dwarf records indicate the first incursions of Skaven into Karak Varn, where they eventually capture most of the flooded lower levels.

Lacking followers he begins to experiment with corpses and skeletons and succeeds in animating them. He uses his Undead slaves to excavate mines beneath Cripple Peak and to create Nagashizzar, the Cursed Pit, a giant underground fortress full of alchemical laboratories, barracks, foundries and armouries. Dust and slag from the mines soon turns the land all about to waste, creating the Desolation of Nagash.
