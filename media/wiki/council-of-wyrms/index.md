Council of Wyrms is a D&D boxed set, published in 1994, that includes rules
for playing dragon, half dragon, and dragon servant characters. It includes
three rule books: one for the base rules, one for dragon family and clan
histories, and one for adventure modules. In 1999 it was slightly revised and
reprinted as a hardcover book. This campaign setting is no longer officially
supported.
