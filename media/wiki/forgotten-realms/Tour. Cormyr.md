> Cormyr was once the kingdom of Azoun IV, "The Purple Dragon". However, his passing now leaves his kingdom to his infant son. The current regent holds power until the lad reaches the age to take the throne.

# Cormyr

Cormyr (Core-MEER) is one of the handful of proper nations in the North. Cormyr straddles the land in the northeast region of the Sea of Fallen Stars between the Lake of Dragons and Anauroch. It was at one time a heavily wooded region, but is now a land of small forests and organized farms. The surviving woods are as thick and dangerous as Cormanthor, but these areas are now outnumbered by terrain cleared for use by the cities and landed lords of Cormyr.

Cormyr is also called the Forest Country and the Land of the Purple Dragon. It is a rich kingdom; its southern, eastern, and northwestern areas have many farms, offering abundant yield for trade. The central areas of the kingdom are still wooded; these woods, carefully husbanded by the forces of the king, still yield good timber and have plentiful game.

Cormyr is also strategically located on overland trade routes from the cities of the Moonsea to the northeast; the Dalelands to the east; the Inner Sea (on which it has two major ports, Suzail and Marsember); and the lands to the west, northwest, and south - particularly the rich city-states and kingdoms of the Sword Coast.

Cormyr is a wet land, receiving abundant rain in summer and spring and abundant snow in winter.  It has long, cold winters, and short but hot summers. Much of spring and fall is temperate and moist, and as a result, Cormyr's farms and forests are both green and rich in yield and splendor. Fog is common along the seacoast, and there are often mists present on the High Moors, extending in to the pass at High Horn and the gorge north of Eveningstar.

## Government

Cormyr is a hereditary monarchy. The present king is Azoun IV, a regal, middle-aged man (in his fifties) of sophisticated tastes and keen wits, son of the famed warrior-king Rhigaerd II. Azoun has ruled from his hilltop palace in Suzail and the Royal Court of interconnected public buildings below it since 1336 DR.  However, he is rumored to travel the land in disguise to learn more about his people. Azoun has proved himself a surefooted and careful monarch and military leader. He not only organized the crusade against the Tuigans in 1360 DR, but killed the leader of the enemy horde in single combat.

The king takes council from the Royal Magician, Vangerdahast, a wizard of great power and Azoun's mentor, teacher, and friend. Much of what Azoun knows of the world has been shown him by Vangerdahast, who today is known as Azoun's "pet wizard" and considered the power behind the throne.  Vangerdahast is the most powerful wizard in Cormyr, and his loyalty is totally to the crown.

The king taxes lightly and makes the law by his decrees in the Court of the Crown. In addition to the tithe collected by the local lords, discussed below, there is a royal tax of 1 gp per head annually - 5 gp for wealthy landowners.

Azoun's banner is the Purple Dragon (a purple dragon on a white field); it is borne often by a strong standing army under the command of the Lord High Marshal of the Kingdom, Duke Bhereu. For major endeavors, the king himself leads the way, following in the footsteps of his father Rhigaerd.

## History

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses of Cormyr and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line.

The land has been officially at peace for many years - since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean forces have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, and the nation has recently mustered its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading the Realms from the east. One wit has noted, "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy."

In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling ores and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by evil raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.

## Lords of Cormyr

The king rules by means of appointed lords, one in each town or smaller city, and by the fealty of the landed nobility and the rich merchant lords. The landed nobility is extensive and interbred such that most can claim a drop of two of royal blood somewhere in their veins, but it centers around two dozen major families. The merchant lords are the wealthiest caravan and business owners of the day.

Local lords are responsible for defending the local farms, dispensing the king's justice, keeping the peace, serving as the king's eyes and ears, and (most importantly) collecting tithes for the king and for themselves (1 sp/head/year). Each lord is allowed up to 40 men-at-arms, plus up to six guides/captains (typically rangers). These may serve as the town guard. Volunteer town guardsmen are known as the watch, and may, upon the judgment of the lord, be exempted from the tax if their service has been valuable. Lords are also requested to stable and maintain a fit, fast horse of the best quality for the use of the king's messengers, who ride fast and far, requiring them to change mounts at every stop.

The relationship between the landed nobility and the appointed local lords is generally good, though many established families treat the local servants of the crown as no more than royal lackeys to be bossed about or flattered as need be. The financial health of local nobles can usually be discerned by the degree to which they fawn over the local lord.

### Lords and Heralds of Cormyr

Local lords are summarized here. Towns are listed in order of size and importance. Cormyr has three major cities (Suzail, Marsember, and Arabel), and the remainder of its settlements are small towns similarto those found in the Dales. Each lord musthave an assistant who serves as a clerk and recordkeeper and is a trained herald. (Heralds are listed with their respective masters.)

Suzail: Sthavar, Lord Magister of the City of Suzail, rules in the name of King Azoun IV and acts as commander of his Purple Dragons. Sthavar's herald is Xrorn Backhand.

Marsember: Marsember's lord is Ildool, a grasping hack politico who would gladly sell out to the highest bidder were it not for his herald Bledryn Scoril, who endeavors to keep him on the straight and narrow.

Arabel: Arabel's lord is a lady, the noble Myrmeen Lhal, a ranger of great power and repute. She is aided in governing by Westar of the Gates.

Tilverton: Tilverton only recently gained official status among the
lords, though is still considered a protectorate. Tilverton's lord is
Lady Regent Alasalynn Rowanmantle, and her herald is a young diplomat
named Cuthric Snow.

Waymoot: Waymoot's local lord is Lord Filfar Woodbrand (also called
"Trollkiller" Woodbrand). Dhag Greybeard serves as herald for him and
Lord Commander Dembarron in High Horn.

Wheloon: Wheloon's lord is a headstrong youth grown into a headstrong
man, Sarp Redbeard. His herald is Estspirit.

Immersea: Samtavan Sulacar is the lord of Immersea, a position he views
as being close to being in retirement. This is because most of the real
work is picked up by his herald, Culspiir.

Eveningstar: This small community is ruled by another female warrior,
Tessaril Winter, and her herald Tzin Tzummer. In the lands of Cormyr,
female rulers are more common than in the Dales.

Dhedluk: The appointed lord of Dhedluk is Thiombur, a jovial and
conversant individual with connections everywhere. His herald is a
young woman named Ildul.

Hilp: The small town of Hilp has Doon Dzavar as its local lord.  His
herald is the wizard Delzantar.

Espar: Hezom of Helm has left his church to aid King Azoun in
government. Hezom's herald is a reformed rogue named "Yellow Hand"
Yespar.

Tyrluk: Suldag the Boar, a warrior of great prowess and greater girth,
is the appointed lord of Tyluk. His herald is his former squire Nzal
"Tooth" Tursa.

High Horns: High Horn is a military outpost and is ruled in the king's
name by Lord Commander Thursk Dembarron. His herald is Dhag Greybeard,
who is also the herald for nearby Waymoot.

Cormyte Defense
---------------

To enforce the royal word Cormyr maintains a large standing army,
which has increased dramatically in the last decade.  More than 12,000
Purple Dragons (called such for the banner of Cormyr) are now
garrisoned in major cities and fortifications. A 25-ship imperial navy
patrols out of Suzail, the palace guard numbers some 150 trained elite
warriors, and the nation maintains a mounted force of 500 warriors
trained in sword and bow led by 30 knights out of the Court. Most of
these elite units are veterans of the crusade against the Horde and are
members of the Order of the Golden Way, a military order commemorating
those battles.  But the most deadly unit in the army is the widely
feared War Wizards, mages who are known for their black-and-purple
robes.

Wizards in Cormyr
-----------------

Mages of any rank of power, from thaumaturgists (5th level) and up,
must by law report their names, sigils, and dwelling places to the
Royal Magician, Vangerdahast, in Suzail. Such spellcasters are also
required to give their names whenever challenged in Cormyr by soldiers
of the king or officers of the Court upon pain of magical destruction
at the hands of the Royal Magician or the Council of Mages (the
aforementioned War Wizards).

The Cormyrean Mindset
---------------------

Cormyr is one of the most civilized and responsible nation in
Faerun. The people have a strong loyalty to their government and king,
and tend to be law-abiding and peaceable unless put upon. For its part,
the government of Cormyr seems almost enlightened in dealing with its
people. There is a strong noble class, a vibrant freeman or commoner
class, and a growing merchant class. The everyday situation has
improved within the past generation for most Cormytes, and they are
quite content.

Cormyreans are friendly and open, and see themselves as cultured,
peaceful, and refined. They fight when they have to and to protect the
rights of others. Having achieved peace within their own borders,
Cormytes and their leaders look elsewhere to see what they can do.

Often Cormyreans see the rest of the world as a dangerous and evil
place, needing a strong hand to control it. The Dalesmen are good at
heart, but too disorganized to make a credible stand against the evil
of the Moonsea. Waterdeep and Sembia seem to spend too much time
counting money to fight their foes. The independent states of the Vast,
the Western Heartlands, and the Dragon Coast are sprawling and
disorganized. Someone has to bring peace to the world, and it might as
well be the followers of the Purple Dragon.

Cormyreans are often perceived as being elitist and isolated from
the troubles of the day. Their response is to point out that should it
be their fault that they have put their nation in order, showing the
value of a wise king, a good people, and a strong military force?

Adventurers in Cormyr are viewed as a curiosity; adventurers native
to Cormyr are an aberration or following a passing fancy.  The idea
that people would risk their lives needlessly for gold or glory strikes
many natives as odd, a throwback to darker days when that sort of thing
was necessary. However, despite this attitude, there are more than
enough dragons, goblin hordes, and evil emissaries of the gods to keep
the brave at heart busy in Cormyr.

Adventuring in Cormyr

The military history of Cormyr has long been one of guerrilla
ambushes and running skirmishes, with its army only conducting set
piece battles outside its borders. The Court is thus very sensitive to
the presence of armed people within the kingdom (that is, armed people
who do not owe their allegiance to the king). Lawless freeswords cannot
operate within Cormyr. Mercenaries cannot gather, while armed, in
groups of more than five in any place save public markets or inns and
taverns (and in the latter, it is customary to surrender all weapons to
a custodian behind the bar). Violators face immediate disarmament,
forfeiture of goods, and imprisonment at the hands of the local watch
or soldiers of the king.

The exceptions to this decree are when such fighters are operating
under hire; under contract to someone authorized to hire them
(nobility, or chartered merchants) as caravan or warehouse guards, or
as bodyguards; or by permission of the king. Save in times of war,
permission of the king is granted only in the form of a royal charter.

A royal charter can be obtained only from the Lord Commander at High
Horn, the Warden of the Eastern Marches in Arabel (Baron Thomdor), or
the Chancellor or Lord High Marshal at the Royal Court in Suzail. The
king can of course grant one at any time, anywhere.  Such charters
customarily cost 1,000 gp, a further tax of 300 gp a year, and can be
revoked without warning at any time. The annual fee is payable upon the
anniversary of the issuance of the original charter, with a late
penalty of 20 gp per day thereafter, accuiring up to 10 days later. Any
further delay results in automatic suspension of the charter and a
warrant for the arrest and detention of any such mercenaries operating
within the boundaries of Cormyr thereafter.

Charters are customarily given to a company of adventurers. Such a
company may not number more than 30 persons at any one time.  All
members of the chartered company must wear the arms or badge of their
company at all times when armed in Cormyr. Finally, the names of the
members of any such company must be on file in Suzail any changes in
rosters being reported once a month to the aforementioned officers in
High Horn, Suzail, Arabel, or the high constable of the King's Garrison
at Waymoot.

Customs
-------

The nation of Cormyr has a number of customs that the traveler
should recognize when operating there. These customs include:

 * Commoners of both sexes bow their heads to royalty.

 * Burials are followed by wakes.

 * It is unlucky and an offense to the gods to kill a cat, for cats are
the eyes and messengers of deities. It is good to keep a cat, but a
sin to clip its tail, ears, or fur or hamper its ability to produce
kittens. A cat may not be kept in a cage.

 * Women interested in finding a mate wear purple scarves at hip and/or
throat.

 * Adventurers who go in peace, but armed, wear peacestrings about
their swordhilts (to prevent quick unsheathings).  These strings are
colored and tasselled cords, and it is an art to tie them in ornate
knots. The best of such knots look complicated, but may be undone
with a single jerk to free the weapon.

Gondegal the Lost King

Arabel was independent for a brief time in recent memory, the center
of a swordsman's empire. This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King,
who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom
for himself centered on Arabel and extending north to the Desertsmouth
Mountains, south and west of Wyvernwater and the farms outlying from
Eveningstar, and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes.

"Gondegal's reach was longer than his blade," people say. He Could
not hold any of his territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia,
Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales - all of whom he
drew the blood and ire of In the making of his throne.

Gondegal ruled for less than a season. He reigned officially for
scarcely eight days, the remainder of his rule being spent fighting
here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed. His
troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was
small and soon gone. One night Gondegal's force simply melted away
before the advancing host of Cormyr and was gone.

The forces of King Azoun IV retook Arabel on the mom without wetting
a blade. No one found Gondegal's body. He is known to have fled north
and then east, via Teshwave, and then his fate becomes a matter of
conflicting rumor and legend. Most believe he still lives with a score
or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a
careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive one of his
attacks to carry tales anywhere. When entire caravans vanish at times
anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed in
the taverns.

Gondegal is said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable
personal skill and intelligence. His badge is a gray wolfs head, face
on, with red eyes. Caravan guards often warn merchants to beef up the
escort on a particular caravan, "else thy gold'll soon be gilding
Gondegal's throne." Gondegal was a fighter of 20th level and chaotic
neutral alignment, and is proficient with both long sword and
two-handed broad sword. Whether he yet lives, the magic or treasure he
carries, and who his allies might be are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the king of Cormyr, at
that time in his second decade of rule. Not only was Azoun forced to
put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to
pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a
nation as opposed to a city-state. Further, the bloodless assault on
Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and
the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.

The Red Ravens

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in
Cormyr, the Red Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords but can
easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently
large contract. They have been kept on retainer by the government
Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the
north. They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the
Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the
Horde crusade. They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as
they do not wish to jeopardize their royal charter. Most of their
troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords.  They
charge 200 gp per week for the services of their 110-being unit.  Their
symbol is a red raven amulet.

Nobility in Cormyr

Suzail is the center of the kingdom and the home of its court. The
landed lords and petty nobility of the nation come here to pay tribute
(and gain favors from) the crown. Most of the nobility is many
generations old, some are as old as Obarskyr line itself, the line from
which the kings of Cormyr descended. Many are wealthy or powerful in
their own rights, and some are poor as temple mice, existing by dint of
imperial largesse. Many have large extant lands outside of Suzail but
maintain apartments and townhouses for the court season.

Regardless of financial station, the nobility of Cormyr is regarded
(at least by its members) as being superior due to its birth status and
charged with helping direct the ship of state (though not handling the
day-to-day operation - that's the work for the local lords and
adventuring types).

A partial listing of the Cormyrean nobles include the following:

 * Bleths of Suzail.

 * Cormaerils of Suzail and Cormyr.

 * Crownsilvers of the Royal House of Cormyr.

 * Dauntinthorns of Suzail.

 * Emmarasks of Suzail.

 * Huntcrowns of Suzail.

 * Huntsilvers of the Royal House of Cormyr.

 * Illances of Suzail.

 * Marliirs of Arabel.

 * Rowanmantles of Suzail.

 * Silverswords of Suzail.

 * Skatterhawks of Cormyr.

 * Thunderswords of Starwater Meadow (south of Hilp).

 * Truesilvers of the Royal House in Marsember.

 * Wyvernspurs of Immersea.

The Truesilvers, Huntsilvers, and Crownsilvers are considered Royal
Houses because of their close blood ties with the line of King Azoun.
The Cormaerils are the largest house in Cormyr, with hangers-on and
fringe nobility in every court and council in Cormyr, and have a strong
heritage of second- and third-born children going adventuring. The
Rowanmantles have the ruler of Tilverton and the co-rule of Shadowdale
in their line, The Skatterhawks are nouveau riche, having been made
barons a scant hundred years ago, and still engage heavily in
mercantile behavior.

An adventurer who wishes to be from "good blood" and noble station
should choose a family name from this list. The Cormaerils are the best
choice, since even the family historians are unsure of the number of
possible heirs, sinister branches, and illegitimate young in the family
tree.

Cormyrean Patrols

Travelers through the gaps and other dangerous regions may encounter
Cormyrean  patrols assigned to protect caravans and keep the peace. A
Cormyrean patrol numbers 12 fighters of 1st level led by a 4-level
fighter, with a 50% chance of a 3rd-6th level War Wizard, as well, All
are mounted on medium horse with leather barding, and the fighters are
armored in banded mail. Such patrols are instructed not to interfere
with normal merchant traffic, to inform travelers to Cormyr of customs,
and to avoid engagements with superior forces. If such a battle is
inevitable, the majority of the troops are to hold the enemy while one
gallops to make a report.

Locations of Interest
---------------------

Cormyr's three major cities are Suzail, Marsember, and Arabel, and
it features quite a number of small towns. These cities and towns, as
well as other notable features of Cormyr, are discussed here.

Arabel

Arabel is a fair-sized city of almost a thousand main buildings,
situated where the East Way meets Calantar's Way in eastern Cormyr. It
is a fortified city, though it has many posts for trading houses
outside its walls.

Arabel is first and foremost a merchant city, famed for its jewelry,
principally that of the merchant house of Thond. A number of trading
companies have major outposts here, and there is always a floating pool
of mercenary talent to be hired at any time, the largest unit being the
Red Ravens. The city is also the main shipping area for coal in Cormyr,
gathering coal from mines in the Gnoll Pass area. A map of Arabel may
be found on page 46,

The major trading companies in Arabel include a number of multicity
costers and priakos - Dragoneye Dealing, Six Coffers, Thousandheads,
Trueshield, and the dubious Iron Throne (not to be confused with the
Iron House of the dwarves). Local merchant houses include Baerlear,
Bhela, Gelzunduth, Hiloar, Kraliqh, Misrim, Nyaril, and Thond.

Arabel has one major temple, the Lady's House, devoted to the
worship of Tymora. It was here that the avatar of the Luck Maiden
appeared to the populace and protected the city during its dark time.
As a result, the church has grown further in power under the wise (and
some say high-handed) leadership of Daramos Lauthyr (CG hm P11). The
Lady's House is the major healing force in Arabel, with 24 priests
answering to Lauthyr's call.

The most notable of Tymora's servants in Arabel is Doust Sulwood (CG
hm P8), former lord of Shadowdale. Doust strongly tries to mitigate
Lauthyr's abrasive personality.

Arabel is also noted for a number of fine inns and taverns, the most
notable being the Dancing Dragon and the Wild Goose (better known by
its other name, the World Serpent). The best inn in the city is the
Pride of Arabel, for those who can afford it.

Arabel is currently ruled by Myrmeen Lhal (NG hf R12).  Myrmeen's
lordship tends to turn on the fact that she permits the traders and
merchants to engage in whatever tactics they see fit, as long as no one
is hurt and the crown is not endangered.  Arabel's military forces are
overseen by the Warden of the Eastern Marches, Baron Thomdor, who in
addition to being a capable warrior (LG hm F17) is the cousin of King
Azoun.

Calantar's Way

Calantar's Way is a cart road running from Suzail to Arabel in
Cormyr, and has been named for the man who surveyed and built it over
400 winters ago. It has been carefully tended by the merchants and
soldiers who use it.

Castle Crag

Formerly the easternmost outpost of Cormyr on the road to Tilverton,
Castle Crag remains an important defensive operation in the Realms
army, due to the unstable and dangerous nature of the Stonelands.
Castle Crag defends Gnoll Pass.

Some 500 Purple Dragons make up the permanent garrison here, along
with a detachment of the War Wizards. The garrison commander is Bren
Tallsword (LN hm F10), a stiff-necked martinet who insists on drills
and inspections on an all too regular basis. However, Tallsword is the
exact person the crown wants in this position - a warrior who will
fight to his last soldier to give the other forces, situated in Arabel,
time to set up defenses and plan a counterstroke.  Bren answers to the
Warden of the Eastern Marches in Arabel.

Adventurers are not particularly welcome in Castle Crag, and those
who arrive are told to complete their business and be off. There are a
few small buildings along the road, used as taverns and hostels, but
they are regularly leveled by Tallsword, who is concerned about morale
(they are regularly rebuilt by the soldiers and other adventurers, with
a wink and a nod from the Warden of the Eastern Marches).

Dhedluk

Dhedluk (pronounced dead-LUKE) is a small town of a hundred
buildings surrounded by a wooden stockade with a single obvious gate.
It is situated just north and west of the meeting of the Ranger's Way
and Starwater Road in central Cormyr.

Dhedluk rests calmly at the heart of the King's Forest, and is a
generally peaceful community of farmers and foresters. A local hero and
famous adventurer, Thiombar the fighter, runs an inn, the Blushing
Maiden, at the center of town. Thiombar (NG hm F8) is the appointed
local lord of Dhedluk, and is said to know everyone in Cormyr.

Thiombar is a master of the skill of putting the correct people in
touch with each other, and his inn is often a stopping point for those
seeking an individual of a certain skill or ability. There is a 50%
chance that Thiombar knows someone who might help a PC, though his fee
is usually no less than 200 gp per level of the individual he is
helping or referring to (whichever is higher).  Thiombar will never aid
in situations where someone within the Royal Court is threatened, and
in such cases will tip the authorities off.

Thiombar's attitude towards the position of lord of Dhedluk is that
he is doing the crown a favor, and the retired fighter would be as
happy just to hoist drinks. The crown, on the other hand, is pleased to
have such a source of information at its disposal.  Vangerdahast
himself is said to be a regular visitor, just to heft a mug and swap a
tale with his old friend and informant.

Espar

Situated in the rich farmland north of Waymoot, Espar is a
scattering of about 120 stone buildings without central plan or
defense.

Espar is the archetypical quiet Cormyrean farming town. It has a
single inn, the Watchful Eye, whose common room is usually filled with
local farmers; travelers are a rarity. Espar's greatest claims to fame
are its appointed lord and a local smithy renowned for its sword
Grafting.

Espar's lord is Hezom (LG hm P10), a priest of Helm on leave from
his church to fill this position for the crown. He still performs
healing for the sick and wounded, and exemplifies the finer spirit of
Helm's ethos of guardianship. Hezom maintains a small shrine to Helm in
the town.

Eveningstar

Eveningstar is an unfortified town of 50 or so main structures
situated where the High Road crosses the Starwater. Eveningstar is a
crossroads village and home to skilled craftsmen who produce wine,
parchment, and wool for the weavers in Suzail and Daerlun.  Eveningstar
is a market for the small, but good, farms in the vicinity.

Several good inns serve the traveler and adventurer, including the
Lonesome Tankard, whose proprietor is Duman Kiriag (NG hm F5), and the
Golden Unicorn, Selda Imyara, proprietor. A third inn, the Welcoming
Hand, is still a burnt-out ruin, the result of a magical bar brawl.

Eveningstar's lord is Tessaril Winter (CG hf W12/F10), who is both
quick and efficient in her duties to the crown. She is aided by her
herald Tzin Tzummer (NG hm B7) and the town clerk, Aldo Morim (NG hm
F3). Tessaril has a soft spot for adventurers and aids them when
possible.

Eveningstar is a regular watering hole for the disguised king of
Cormyr when he is out pressing the flesh, as the king is an old friend
of Tessaril. Most of the natives know Azoun by sight, and treat his
majesty as one of their own.

Eveningstar has one large temple, the House of the Morning,
dedicated to Lathander. Its patriarch is Charisbonde Trueservant (NG hf
P11). The House of the Morning is also the home of a retired Knight of
Myth Drannor, Jelde Asturien of Lathander (NG hm P9). The sarcastic
former Knight acts as the temple's seneschal, and is known to carry a
ring of spell storing with three raise deads and two flame strikes
stored in it.

Eveningstar's only other feature of note is a type of flying cat
found in the area. These cats, known as tressym, have free run of the
place, and are treated as mascots and signs of good luck. Lord Tessaril
has a tressym as a familiar.

Eveningstar, like Shadowdale in the Dales, is located near a
collection of ruins and underground caverns. The most notable of these
is the Haunted Halls. Hidden within a steep-sided gorge north of
Eveningstar, the Haunted Halls consist of a ruined keep and a nearby
cavern complex, though most think only of the keep as the Haunted
Halls.

The Haunted Halls were a long-standing bandit hold, cleaned out most
recently during the reign of King Azoun III, and unoccupied since. They
have been raided several times since then by adventuring companies, but
rumors persist that the Halls hold rich treasure.

The Farsea Marshes and the Marsh of Tun

Two great swamps lie on the far side of the Storm Horns, away from
the civilized lands of Cormyr. The Farsea Marshes are the birthplace of
the Tun River. Farther down its course, the swampy banks widen to form
the Marsh of Tun. The entire valley of the Tun is boggy and prone to
sudden sinks and marshy ground, but the trend is most widespread at
these two designated marshes.

The two marshes share another feature, for each is reputed to have
been the home of a great forgotten civilization. Such a civilization
would have to have existed before the elves themselves, for there is no
record among them of anything other than swamp in the area. Yet,
adventurers have described ruined buildings of ornate shapes made of
glass strengthened to the resiliency of steel being here. Such
declarations are usually followed by the quick sickness and death of
the speaker, since these swamps are also the home of pestilence and
plague.

Without any idea of the facts, bards have fitted in a story of two
great city-states ruled by lovers who had a falling out, a disagreement
that escalated into a magical war which sank both cities, poisoned the
land, and bred all manner of disease. Each was supposedly advised by an
old woman, who is revealed at the end of the tale to have been Talona.

The truth of the matter remains unknown, but adventurers continue to
brave the deadly nature of these bogs to recover greater gold and
glory. It is known that the lawless human tribes of the Tun have banded
together under the command of a warlord, Thaalim Torchtower (LE hm F9),
who operates an effective bandit kingdom, raiding caravans as they pass
out of Cormyr. It is rumored that he has spies and agents throughout
the Forest Kingdom and the Dragon Coast.

Goblin Marches and the High Moors

A thousand years ago when Myth Drannor was its height, the goblins
and their inhuman allies ruled this wide plain. Theirs was a powerful
race of inhuman warriors mounted on dire wolves and other strange
beasts, and they raided at will the ancient kingdoms of Asram and
Anauria, destroying the latter in 200 DR. Even the newborn city-state
of Suzail saw the attacks of these organized evil foes.

But the goblins at last met an enemy they could not defeat in the
form of the Great Desert Anauroch. The land dried out, and the soil
lifted in great, blinding clouds. The goblins' mighty war empire fell
apart as the people in it fled eastward to the Stonelands, westward to
the Fallen Lands, and south into the High Moors. One organized
surviving army laid siege to Tethyamar, the golden gem of the dwarves,
and wrested it from the Iron House. These goblins and ores, as cunning
as they once were, now rule that land.

The Goblin Marches is now a sliver of land between the desert and
the Storm Horns, growing smaller with each passing decade.  There are
still goblins here - broken, raiding peoples who attack each other's
encampments as much as human travelers. With High Horn and Castle Crag
in human hands, the rich lands of Cormyr are barred to them. The ores,
gnolls, ogres, and other humanoid races battle, raid, and live a
miserable borderline existence.

The High Moors to the south of Anauroch, the foothills of the Storm
Horns, are like the Goblin Marches, only moreso. Here can be found the
ruined citadels and giant-built castles of the dispersed races,
occupied by the savage remnants of these peoples. Because of their
location, the High Moors remain unexplored by Cormyreans or Dalesmen,
and tales continually surface concerning lost civilizations and
ancient, elder powers brooding in these hills, alien to all humans.

One human group that has been active in the Goblin Marches is the
Zhentarim, operating out of Dagger Falls and the Darkhold.  The Goblin
Marches occupy the main caravan route for the Black Network, and the
Zhentarim rotate between paying off the goblins, hiring them, or wiping
them out, depending on who the current military leader is. The
Zhentarim are said to have imported powerful monsters whom goblinkind
might follow in the hope of raising armies aligned with their sides,
but their results have been spotty at best. The goblin tribes are still
not powerful enough to challenge even a small unit of Cormyrean
knights.

Helmlands

The Helmlands are the name given to the foothills surrounding the
eastern Storm Horns near Gnoll Pass and Castle Crag. During the Time of
Troubles, these lands erupted in a series of bubbling tar pits, which
scarred the region. To make matters worse, the area is marked with
widespread and random wild magic and dead magic areas where the rules
of spellcasting break down or fail entirely.  The problematic magic
areas have been reduced since the Time of Troubles, but this land has
become a fell and evil place. It is called the Helmlands as a reminder
that Helm was supposedly responsible for keeping the gods' avatars in
Faerun, letting them wreak havoc. The lands are also called the Pits of
Mystra.

The chief long-lasting legacy of this region is that it has provided
a toehold for those border raiders who can press down past Castle Crag,
and they use it as a base of operations for raiding around Arabel.
Twice the combined forces of the Red Ravens and the Purple Dragons
(with the less effective help of the War Wizards) have cleansed the
area, and each time more goblins, gnolls, and ores have made their way
to it.

Rumors in the Royal Court state that Vangerdahast is working on a
great magic that will remove the Helmlands, or at least send them
somewhere like Thay where they will be appreciated. Of course, rumor in
the Royal Court regularly says that Vangerdahast is working on this
great magic or that. If he is doing so, he is holding his own counsel
on the matter.

Hermit's Wood

Located just south of Wheloon, the Hermit's Wood takes its name from
a ghostly figure that is often seen on nights of a full moon. This
figure appears as a man in gray robes, carrying a lantern which shines
with an eerie blue light. Some call this the spirit of the original
hermit who lived in the woods in the time of Azoun II, while others say
that it is fantasy or will-o'-the-wisps.

The Hermit's Wood is filled with game and singularly lacking in
sentient nonhuman creatures. It has been extensively lumbered by people
out of Wheloon.

High Horn

The High Horn is a great, grim fortress of high curving walls and
frowning towers, and is the center of Cormyr's military operations in
the west. The great towers of the High Horn were once essential, but
are now no longer so heavily used. It is still the strongest defensive
position in the realm of Cormyr. It guards the road to the West and a
strategically important mountain pass, and was built to protect against
the border raiders (bandits) and the lizard men of the marshes
(although these latter have not proved troublesome since it was built).

High Horn has a guest enclave, where travelers can stay, but is
strictly a military community. The High Horn is the wintering quarters
of half the Cormyrean army, and it has extensive facilities to host
both people and animals through a season-long siege.  In recent years,
the walls have been strengthened and discipline tightened, in the face
of the growing menace of Zhentarim-controlled Darkhold to the far west.

There is a standing garrison of 400 soldiers at High Horn at any
time: 100 archers and 300 men-at-arms, led by a 4th-level fighter for
every 10 soldiers, and under the overall control of the lord commander
of High Horn. The position of lord commander is appointed annually by
the king, and he is currently Thursk Dembarron(LG hm P15).

In addition to its other defenses, the War Wizards are making their
base at this keep. There will always be at least three mages of 6th
level present at any one time, and a 50% chance of a spellcaster of
7th-12th level in residence at any time.

Hilp

Hilp is a small town in southern Cormyr. It is a sleepy village
between Immersea and Suzail, named for the warrior who founded it long
ago by slaying or driving out all the trolls that infested the area. It
is unfortified and surrounded by rolling hills. It is the local
farmers' market and has a large cooper and wagonmaker business.

The local lord of Hilp is a former merchant named Doon Dzavar.  Doon
is not a native to Cormyr, but has worked hard in his tenure to earn
the approval of both the people of Hilp and the crown.

Hullack Forest

One of the large remaining shards of the great woods that was
Cormanthor, the western edge of Hullack was once considered the eastern
border of Cormyr. As the nation grows and acquires new land to the
north, settlers have begun to move into Hullack as well.

Hullack is a more primeval forest than the King's Forest, filled
with dark valleys and hidden dales unseen by mortals for generations.
Legends of ghostly creatures and strange monsters pepper local tales
and caravan stories, and ores and goblins regularly descend from the
Thunder Peaks into this region.

For Cormyr to grow, the Hullack must be tamed, and the crown has
notified several adventuring companies that riches and a minimum of
government interference are to be found there.

Hultail

Hultail is a small village on the eastern shores of the Wyvernwater.
No more than a handful of buildings, it does not even rate its own
appointed lord. Instead, its matters with the crown are handled by Sarp
Redbeard of Wheloon.

Hultail is typical of hundreds of small villages and hamlets
scattered throughout Cormyr. Its only notable quality is that it is the
only true port on the eastern Wyvernwater, and that it guards the
"secret door" into Cormyr.

Most trade into Cormyr from the east passes through the Thunder
Peaks through three gaps, or to the south around the southern extreme
of the Vast Swamp. A fourth way exists, through the High Dale, past
Hooknose Crag, and down the river to Hultail. This secret entrance is
little used, though Dalesmen and others use it to pass into Cormyr
without raising a ruckus.

The natives of Hultail are on very good terms with the Dalesmen
tradesmen who pass through and benefit from those items that are being
smuggled into or out of the country. Recently, a retired War Wizard
named Fractus (N hm W7) has set up shop nearby, and most of the locals
believe he is there as a spy of the crown.

Immersea

Perched on the western edge of the Wyvernwater, Immersea is an
unfortified town of about a hundred structures, with several large
manors to the south and west of the city. Immersea is a way town on the
road, a stopover and watering-place for horses and livestock, as it is
right on the Wyvernwater. A large inn, the Five Fine Fish, produces its
own potent and justly famed ale here.  Immersea has no temples, but a
shrine to Selune is maintained nearby by Mother Lledew (CG hf P9).
Immersea is also home to the mistfishers, who go out in the morning
mists to catch fish in the Wyvernwater with long draglines and scoop
nets. A map of the Immersea area can be found on page 52.

The great manor to the south and west, called Redstone for its
color, is the ancestral home of the Wyvernspur family, a group of petty
nobles who have regained prominence in the area through the actions of
the family hero, Giogi Wyvernspur. Giogi, through his heroic efforts,
has gained the ability to transform himself into a wyvern. He and his
wife, a mage named Cat, have settled down and are raising a family.

This castle is also the current abode of Samtavan Sulacar (LN hm
F3), the local lord appointed by the king. Samtavan is neither local
(he is a native of Suzail) nor a very effective lord, and his main
occupation is to stay out of the way while his herald handles the
important business of the area.

The other major family in the area is the Cormaerils, a noble house
spread widely throughout Cormyr. The Cormaerils of Immersea are
considered a minor branch of the line, but still maintain a nice manor
known as the High Towers.

King's Forest

Cormyr is defined by its forest, one of the westernmost pieces of
ancient Cormanthor, now abandoned by the elves to humankind.  The woods
is a collection of oak, maple, and rowan trees, with little undergrowth
and a high, open canopy. It is riddled by major roads and cradles the
small towns of Dhedluk and Waymoot.

The King's Forest is the property of the crown. It is rich in game
and wildlife, and save for the occasional monster which wanders down
from the Storm Horns, it is a hunter's paradise.  The law in Cormyr on
poaching is as follows: One may hunt in the King's Forest, provided one
does so on one's own. Large-scale hunts are banned, with offenders
being jailed or assigned to help dredge the Starwater. This law also
gives some of the creatures a fighting chance, and every so often a
hunter loses in a battle with a boar or bear, which keeps spurious
adventurers out.

The King's Forest has no known ruins within its borders, and there
were no ancient empires or fell wizards practicing at the dawn of time
nearby in any living or recorded memory. This may account for the
Cormyrean attitude that all forests of the world should be as safe and
secure as the one controlled by their king.

Marsember

Marsember is the second largest city of Cormyr, and, like the
capital at Suzail, is a seaport on the Dragonmere (the Lake of
Dragons). The city is built on a series of small islands, with each
island crossed and recrossed by a number of canals.

Marsember is the City of Spices, and is so named because four
competing trading families based here have shipped spices to and from
lands far across the Inner Sea for decades, drawing much of the trade
in condiments for the region here.

Because of the large numbers of small fishing boats that work out of
its harbor (or anchor in the mouth of the Wyvernflow, but bring their
catches here for sale), Marsember is the kingdom's busiest port.

Marsember is infamous for the intricate network of sewer-like,
narrow, winding canals that run throughout the entire city. Spans of
•tone connect the upper floors of close buildings, and light skiffs are
poled through the streets. The city was originally built on Marsember
Marsh and expanded over time, taking what territory it Blight. Flat,
hard ground is at a premium in Marsember, so that only the courts of
the wealthy and places of government have large plazas laid out above
the high water mark.

Marsember's sole large church is Morningmist Hall, a temple of
Lathander under the control of High Morninglord Chansobal Dreen (NG hm
P12). He has 16 priests of various levels serving under him.  There are
also shrines to Tymora and Umberlee in the city.

The light skiffs used in the canals of Marsember should be treated
as coracles, though their dimensions are 8-10 feet long and 2-4 feet
wide.

Marsember is ruled in the name of the king by Ildool (CN hm F7), a
grasping political hack who retains his job in part by bemoaning how
terrible it is so that no others covet his post.  Rumors fly that
Ildool skims his tithes to the crown, but all accounting to date has
been proper. It is said that Ildool would Open the city to slavers,
Zhentarim, and other foul creatures if not for the efforts of the War
Wizards and his herald, Bledryn Scoril (LG hm F9), to keep him on the
path of the righteous.

The other major official in Marsember is Ayesunder Truesilver (LG hm
F14), Warden of the Port, charged with protecting a 12-ship detachment
of the Imperial Navy.

Stonelands

The Stonelands are a wide, rocky desolation that lies between Gnoll
Pass and Tilverton. The land gains its name from the great boulders
that seem to be strewn at random throughout its length like monuments
to some forgotten god. A haunted, heavily gouged, sparse wasteland,
this land has long been a haven for tribes of gnolls, ores, goblinoids,
and evil humans, known collectively as border raiders, regardless of
species.

The Zhentarim have been active in both the Stonelands and the Goblin
Marches, seeking to weaken the crown's hold on this region near Cormyr
and at least tie up enough resources so that the Black Network can
operate with a free hand. To that end, there are reports of mad
beholders cruising over the ravine-crossed terrain in the night,
disintegrating anything that gets in their way. The truth has yet to be
revealed, but the Cormyrean patrols and the Red Ravens are very
watchful, and post guards in the evenings.

Storm Horns

Forming the western and northern borders of Cormyr, the Storm Horns
are a massive uplift of sharp-toothed mountains, forbidding to all who
seek to travel through them. They form an unbroken wall from the Lake
of Dragons to High Horn Pass, and a second wall from High Horn to Gnoll
Pass. This impenetrable uprising of land has served as a protector for
Cormyr from attacks from the north and east, but by the same token
prevents any expansion in those directions.

The power of most of the nonhuman tribes on the Cormyrean side of
the Storm Horns has long since been broken, though there are occasions
when a charismatic ore shaman can gather enough small holds together to
form a raiding party. Deeper in the mountains, the tribes of ores and
other nonhumans are stronger, and travelers and prospectors have often
learned that they were in orcish territories only with the first volley
of black-feathered arrows.

The emptying of monsters from the Cormyrean side has also left a
large number of empty caverns and cave complexes that have been
occupied by new creatures. Supreme among them are dragons driven south
by the most recent flight of dragons, who have retreated to their lairs
for a long nap. After a decade, these dragons are now waking, and
waking hungry. Tyrluk, Espar, Waymoot, and Eveningstar have all been
plagued by rogue dragons in the past year. In such cases the best bet
has been to find some adventuring party who will rid the area of the
beast in exchange for its treasure.

The main road out of Cormyr, the High Road, leaves High Horn and
weaves its way down through the foothills of the Storm Horns on the
eastern side, heading south and crossing the River Tun at the Bridge of
Fallen Men. There are two small towns on the route south, not under the
control of Cormyr, but visited with increasing regularity by Cormyrean
patrols.

Eagle Peak is situated on a rocky outcropping overlooking the wide
vale of the Tun River and the Marsh of Tun. It is a small hamlet of a
dozen buildings, including an inn, stables, and a smithy. Its most
recent addition is a small temple of Torm, headed by Lorandia of Torm
(LG hm P5) and three of his followers. Eagle Peak is a regular
overnight stop for caravans in and out of Cormyr.

Skull Crag, farther to the south, has a darker reputation. Located
deeper in the mountains, the community has a stockade around it that is
secured at night (though gold may open the locked gates, nothing else
will). The town is dominated by a shrine to Myrkul (now to Cyric) far
up the mountainside, one of the few shrines to the death god known in
the Heartlands. The whitened marble of a natural outcropping has been
polished and refined to resemble a humanoid skull.  Followers of Myrkul
(and now Cyric) have been known to make pilgrimages to this site of
revelations and wisdom, and the rocks beneath the altar are littered
with their bones. Vultures (of all types) are common near Skull Crag.

Suzail

Suzail is the royal capital and richest city of the kingdom of
Cormyr, and home to the most important merchant houses and nobles of
Cormyr. The city is dominated by the fortified castle of King Azoun IV,
which is set apart from the lower city by its splendid gardens and
rumored to have rich burial grounds beneath it.  A map of Suzail can be
found on page 54.

The city is justly famous for its bazaars, its ivory sculptors, and
its clothmakers. Of the former, hundreds of winters of ivory gleaned
from the Unapproachable East and the hot jungles of the South has found
its way across the Inner Sea in great shiploads of raw tusks and
fragments to here and been fashioned into inlays and goods for Amn, the
North, and the Sword Coast cities. Of the latter, wool is woven as well
in the Sembian city of Daerlun, but those who work looms in Suzail hold
that their work is finer, and the colors more true and more lasting.

The major trading houses in the city are: the Dragoneye Dealing
Coster, the Seven Suns Trading Coster, the Six Coffers Market Priakos,
Trueshield Trading Priakos, and the trading families of Iravan,
Zathchos, Skatterhawk, Jhassalan, Faeri, and Ossper.

Suzail has two major temples. The Towers of Good Fortune are
dedicated to Tymora and presided over by Luckmaster Manarech Eskwuin
(CG hm P12). The Silent Room, the temple to Deneir, is presided over by
Thaun Khelbor (NG hm P10). There are also shrines to Lliira, Oghma,
Tempus, Malar, and Milil within the city.

The First Citizen of the City and the nation is his most Royal
Highness King Azoun IV, King of Cormyr, Protector of Tilverton, and
Victor of the Horde Incursions (LG hm F20). Azoun rarely travels alone
in the city, for he has a personal bodyguard of 6th-8th-level fighters,
and in addition, is often in the company of his court, which includes
among its numbers some of the more powerful Cormyreans, such as the
wizard Vangerdahast. His majesty carries a number of items (rings,
bracers, and the like) that provide immunity from various forms of
attack, and it is rumored that he is the recipient of a specialized
spell that, if he is gravely threatened, will teleport him elsewhere.

Vangerdahast, Royal Magician to the Realm of King Azoun IV and
Chairman Emperius of the College of War Wizards (LN hm W17), is quiet
and unassuming, though highly respected by his peers both for his
knowledge and courtly tact. He does not suffer fools and fops well, but
has an undying loyalty to the crown.

Sthavar, Lord Magister of the City (LG hm F15), is the local lord
entrusted with the day-to-day governing of Cormyr's largest city.
Sthavar maintains a separate residence outside the palace grounds. He
has a complement of six guards of 5th level, and his herald, Xrorn
Hackhand (CG hm R14).

Suzail maintains a large army of Purple Dragons, 14 ships c Imperial
Navy, and a large contingent of the War Wizards (more 65 such wizards
make their home in the city proper).

Adventurers visiting Suzail are usually directed to either the
Dragon's Jaws or the Laughing Lass taverns, both of which commonly deal
with the adventuring trade.

The Thunder Peaks

Forming the eastern border of Cormyr, this chain of mountains runs
north from the High Dale, eventually joining the Desertsmouth Mountain
chain beyond Shadow Gap. It is a wild and unsettled land, the home of
tribes of ores and goblins that bedevil Cormyr, Sembia, and the Dales.

The main pass through the mountains is Thunder Gap, and it carries
most of the trade from Arabel east to the southern Dales and Sembia.
Goblin raids are still common on travelers through this area, and
individuals are warned to go armed and in large groups. Cormyrean
patrols regularly pass through.

The Thunder Peaks, like the Storm Horns, take their name from the
sudden and devastating storms which rake their sides in all seasons. In
the winter, Thunder Gap is sometimes completely closed by heavy snow.

Tilverton and Tilver's Gap

There are three passes through the Thunder Peaks: Thunder Gap in the
south, and Shadow Gap and Tilver's Gap in the north. Roads from Shadow
Gap and Tilver's Gap join at the small city of Tilverton, which has
become important as a strategic location for Cormyr.

In 1357 DR, Tilverton was occupied by Cormyrean forces led by Duke
Bhereu, one of the king's cousins. The given reason was the attacks of
Lashan of Scardale and Zhentil Keep activity, but the crown of Cormyr
has long had its eye on this valuable territory.  The occupation was
made with the tacit approval of the other Dales and Sembia, though both
have since grown concerned about Cormyr's increasing power.

Cormyr has invested a great deal in expanding and improving its new
protectorate. City walls have been erected to cover the sprawling town,
and the main thoroughfares have been lined with cobblestones (they were
previously mud tracks). There is a garrison of 850 Purple Dragons here,
and foot patrols are common on die streets.

Tilverton is ruled by Lady Regent Alasalynn Rowanmantle (CF hf F9),
cousin to Shaerl Rowanmantle of Shadowdale, who oversees a elected
local council. In reality, nothing happens in Tilverton that is not
determined by Cormyr. She is aided by Cuthric Snow (NG hm F2), a young
courtier on his first posting outside Cormyr.

Tilverton has a temple to Gond Wonderbringer operating under the
auspices of Burlan Almaether (N hm PI 2) and 26 lesser priests. It also
has shrines to Helm, Lathander, Silvanus, Tymora, and reportedly,
hidden in the depths of die sewers, secret ones to Mask and Cyric.

Tilverton is still a growing, sprawling town, with many of the
features found in other independent cities. Unlike most of Cormyr, it
still has an organized thieves' guild: the Rogues of Tilverton. The
Rogues have been engaging in a long-running and losing battle with the
War Wizards and the Cormyrean soldiers.

Tyrluk

Tyrluk (pronounced TEER-luke) is a small crossroads village, with a
smithy, a carter, and a farmers' market. Hardy ponies are bred locally,
and many caravans purchase remounts here. A wide pasture is reserved
for caravans to bed down, but there is nothing resembling a inn or
tavern for the wanderer. A stockade protects the city, but it has been
years since any tribes have challenged the might of nearby High Horn,
so the gates are left open at night for late travelers.

The appointed local lord is Suldag the Boar (NG hm F6), a warrior of
moderate merit and incredible girth. His chosen name is said to come
from his hunting ability in the King's Forest, but court wits of late
connected it with his waistline and eating habits. They do this behind
his back - not because Suldag would be horribly offended, but (cause
gossip is much more fun that way.

The Vast Swamp

Situated on the eastern borders of Cormyr, this marsh forms the
order between Cormyr and Sembia. Neither nation claims the swampland,
and neither wants to deal with it unless some ugly monster crawls out
of its depths.

The Vast Swamp is filled with lizard men, hobgoblins, gnolls, and
trolls. Black dragons, beholders, and catoblepas have been reported
within its borders, and will-o'-wisps are commonly spotted from the Way
of the Manticore. The Vast Swamp is probably the single most deadly
location within the borders of Cormyr. The general attitude toward it,
however, is live and let live, since it would take an act of the gods
to fully clean out and drain the huge bog.

The Vast Swamp is also reputed to be a home for necromancers, and
legend says that the Dusk Lord of Sessrendale was not slain, but
retreated to this land to plot his revenge against all the living in
the Dales. This may or may not be true, since while mortals and even
undead do perish, tales live on forever.

Waymoot

A large town within the bounds of the King's Forest, Waymoot is
situated in an artificial clearing five miles across. The center of the
town has a wide stone-walled keep, but the majority of the buildings at
unfortified.

Waymoot is a traders' town in the center of Cormyr where horses and
bred and trained, and wagons are made and fixed. It is home to a
plethora of inns: the Cup and Spoon, the Old Man, the Moon and Stars,
the Silver Wink, and others.

Waymoot's local lord is Filfar Woodbrand (LG hm F10), also called
Trollkiller by the locals. A warrior of great power (18/94 Strength),
Filfar is less than comfortable with the appellation, though it aptly
describes his skill in repelling a troll attack on the town in his
youth.

Waymoot has two small temples, one to Tymora and one to Lliira. The
Tymoran temple is the Sheltering Hand, and it is run by Gothric of
Tymora (CG hm P7) and three supporting priests.  The Lliiricist temple
is the Sounds of Joy, and it is run by Jezarai Moonbolt (NG hef P8) and
three acolytes. Both the temple and its priestess were formerly
dedicated to Waukeen.

Wheloon

Wheloon is a mid-sized town of more than 200 major buildings
situated at the outflow of the Wyvernwater. Its distinctive buildings
have roofs of vibrant green.

This river town grew up around the ferry here that transports
traffic on the Way of the Manticore. Its green-roofed houses are the
result of the use of a native slate for shingles, and have given rise
to the phrase "the jade towers of Wheloon." Many craftsmen work here;
the town houses boatmakers, basketweavers, sailmakers, and potters.

Wheloon is ruled in the name of King Azoun IV by Sarp Redbeard (NG
hm F9), the most headstrong and independent of the appointed local
lords. Sarp is known to disagree with court policy on a number of
matters and has earned few friends in court. He is popular among the
natives of Wheloon, who see Sarp as keeping the Purple Dragon of Cormyr
out of their daily lives.

Wheloon has a single temple to Chauntea that is controlled by
Harandave Donohar (NG hm P16) and 14 of his followers. It also feature
a shrine to Silvanus, under the caretaking of Orlenstar Thirlthorn (N
hm D4).
