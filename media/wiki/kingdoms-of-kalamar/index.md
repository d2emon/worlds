A campaign setting designed and produced by Kenzer & Company. The setting was
one of the first to take advantage of the Open Gaming License and the D20
System, making it the first official D&D setting not produced by TSR/Wizards
of the Coast. The Kalamar setting focuses mainly on six human sub-races on the
world of Tellene and its creators pride themselves on grounding the fantasy
setting in 'reality' by taking advantage of realistic looking geography and
political structures. This campaign setting is no longer officially supported
by Wizards of the Coast. Kenzer & Company has released a pdf exclusive 4th
edition conversion of the 3rd edition rulebooks.
