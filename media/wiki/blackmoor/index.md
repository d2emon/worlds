The original campaign setting played for D&D, created by Dave Arneson.
Although created prior to Greyhawk, Blackmoor was only published later as part
of the distant past of Mystara. In 2004, Blackmoor was again published by
Arneson and Zeitgeist Games. It was also run as a Massively Multiplayer
Role-Playing Game, or MMRPG, a type of living campaign. This campaign setting
is no longer officially supported.
