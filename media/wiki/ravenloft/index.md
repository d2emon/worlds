Темно-фантазийный готический мир.

A gothic horror setting originally created for an adventure module, Ravenloft,
then expanded into an entire series and campaign setting. After years of
production by TSR and WotC, Wizards of the Coast licensed Ravenloft to Arthaus
Games, which published its materials through White Wolf, Inc.'s Sword &
Sorcery Studios label, but rights returned to Wizards of the Coast in
early 2006. In October 2006, Wizards of the Coast released Expedition to
Castle Ravenloft, an updated version of the original module, as a hardcover.
In August 2010, Wizards of the Coast released the Castle Ravenloft board game,
and in 2011 announced the release of the Ravenloft Roleplaying Game, which was
a standalone game that can double as a 4th Edition Campaign Setting. This was
subsequently canceled.
