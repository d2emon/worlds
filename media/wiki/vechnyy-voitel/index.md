The Eternal Champion is a fictional creation of the author Michael Moorcock and
is a recurrent feature in many of his novels.

## About the Eternal Champion

The Multiverse, which consists of several universes, many layered dimensions,
spheres, and alternative worlds, is the place where the eternal struggle
between Law and Chaos, the two main forces of Moorcock's worlds, takes place.
In all these dimensions and worlds, these forces constantly war for supremacy.
Since the victory of Law or Chaos would cause the Multiverse either to become
permanently static or totally formless, the Cosmic Balance enforces certain
limits which the powers of Law and Chaos violate at their peril. Law, Chaos,
and the Balance are active, but seemingly non-sentient, forces which empower
various champions and representatives.

The Eternal Champion, a Hero who exists in all dimensions, times and worlds, is
the one who is chosen by fate to fight for the Cosmic Balance; however, he
often does not know of his role, or, even worse, he struggles against it, never
to succeed. Since his role is to intervene when either Law or Chaos have gained
an excess of power, he is always doomed to be surrounded by strife and
destruction, although he may go through long periods of relative quiet.

All the incarnations of the Eternal Champion are facets of each other, and the
Champion may also be aided by a companion, who, like himself, exists in various
incarnations. Likewise the Champion is often associated with a romantic
interest that is possibly an aspect of an eternal figure. Other characters in
the various books have occasionally crossed over from one universe to another,
although it is unclear what their status in the multiverse may be. Normally,
the incarnations of the Champion do not interact and are treated as a series of
serial incarnations for facets of a single consciousness, but various
cataclysmic events (such as the end of a Cycle of Cycles of the multiverse's
progression, or an invasion by hostile entities from an entirely separate
multiverse) may bring them together in various ways. This is very dangerous (it
causes strains on the fabric of the multiverse as well as mental issues for the
Champion), but amplifies the Champion's power enormously.

In every aspect, the Champion is a warrior almost without peer: when he wields
some version of his usual weapon, the Black Sword (known by various names such
as Stormbringer or Kanajana, although not all versions of the Sword are the
same and some are active entities in their own right) few can stand against
him. He is also usually an adept, if often unwilling, leader of fighters and
has strategic and tactical abilities.

1. Erekosë, Urlik, Clen, Flamadin and Daker are related incarnations of the
   Eternal Champion, in that the individual transforms over the course of
   several novels while maintaining the memories of each and is not
   biologically reborn between each aspect. In addition, he remembers the lives
   of numerous other incarnations.
2. Graf Ulrich von Bek and his descendants are a somewhat unusual family in
   Moorcock's works, as they function both as an aspect of his Eternal Champion
   and as a companion to him.

## Incarnations of the Companion to Champions

Some of the incarnations of the "Companion to Champions" include:

* Jaspar Colinadous (with Elric in the Dream Realm)
* Jhary-a-Conel (mostly Corum, sometimes Hawkmoon)
* Alnac Kreb (Elric's companion in The Fortress of the Pearl)
* Moonglum (Elric's companion for most his journeys)
* Oladahn (Hawkmoon)
* Gurni Gurnisson (Ulrich's companion)

## Incarnations of the Eternal Consort

Some of the incarnations of the "Eternal Consort" include:

* Cymoril (Elric)
* Ermizhad (Erekosë)
* Rhalina (Corum of the Scarlet Robe)
* Yisselda (Hawkmoon)
* Dadrico (Ulrich)

## J&C characters

There is also a very obvious repetition of characters whose first names begins with the letter "j", and whose last names begins with the letter "c" (Moorcock himself poked fun at this in the novel The Fortress of the Pearl). Some of these "J&C" characters seem to be companions, while others seem to be mentors, and still others are champions (and at least one was said to be the Spirit of the Runestaff, an instrument of the Cosmic Balance).

A summary of "J&C" characters created by Michael Moorcock:

* Jaspar Colinadous
* Jehamiah Cohnahlias
* Jeremiah "Jerry" Cornell
* Jermays the Crooked
* Jerry Cornelius
* Jhary-a-Conel
* Jherek Carnelian
* Jagged of Canaria
* J'osui C'reln Reyr
