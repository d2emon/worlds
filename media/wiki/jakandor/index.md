Jakandor, released in 1998, is a self-contained "campaign arena" conceived by
Jeff Grubb. Jakandor is an island divided between the native Charonti, a
civilization that makes heavy use of magic (especially necromancy), and the
Knorr, barbarians who despise the vile practice of magic and have been driven
from a far-away homeland to Jakandor.

The setting was released in the form of three books, as part of the AD&D:
Odyssey line. These books are:

* Jakandor, Island of War (Feb. 1998 ISBN 0-7869-0371-6) detailed the Knorr
  barbarians and eastern side of Jakandor.
* Jakandor, Isle of Destiny (June 1998 ISBN 0-7869-1245-6) detailed the
  Charonti and western side of Jakandor.
* Jakandor, Land of Legend (November 1998 ISBN 0-7869-1246-4) has additional
  information and adventures for characters from both civilisations.

A fourth book Jakandor: Land of Destiny by Jeff Grubb was planned for January
1999 but never released. This campaign setting is no longer officially
supported.
