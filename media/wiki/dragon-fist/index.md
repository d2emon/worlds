Dragon Fist, released on the Wizards of the Coast website, was promoted as a
new role playing game, describing itself in its introduction as an "AD&D
variant". With its debut near the end of the lifespan of second edition, the
variant rules blended rules found in different editions. For example, the game
used the monster template of second edition, but the armor class rules of
third edition. The campaign setting, created by Chris Pramas, is an Oriental
realm known as Tianguo, "a fictional land based on wuxia films and on Chinese
folklore and legend". Beyond the initial release, the product was not
supported.
