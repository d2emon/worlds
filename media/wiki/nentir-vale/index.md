Nentir Vale is the sample community provided as a default setting in the 4th
edition Dungeon Master's Guide. Most sourcebooks refer to the cosmology this
community exists in as simply "the D&D world" though this appears to be an
informal term. The overall setting is one in which great empires of various
races, including tieflings and dragonborn, have long ago or recently fallen.

Towns and other civilization centers are described as "points of light" in an
otherwise dark age, with the DM encouraged by the guidebook to leave the rest
of the world largely unplanned, vague and unpredictable. The deities presented
in the 4th edition Dungeon Master's Guide are a combination of Greyhawk,
Forgotten Realms and newly created gods. What cultural uniformity exists
beyond the Nentir Vale, other than the Material Plane-wide worship of some or
all of these figures, is little.
