# Years of the Lamps

When the Valar entered Arda, it was still lifeless and had no distinct
geographical features. The initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was much
more symmetrical, including the central continent of Middle-earth. Middle-earth
was also originally very much larger, and was lit by the Two Lamps, Illuin and
Ormal, made out of the misty light that veiled the barren ground. The Valar
concentrated this light in two large lamps, Illuin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë
forged two great pillar-like mountains, Helcar in the north and Ringil in the
south. Illuin was set upon Helcar and Ormal upon Ringil. In the middle, where
the light of the lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of [Almaren]()
upon the [Great Lake]().

This period, known as the Spring of Arda, was a time when the Valar had ordered
the World as they wished and rested upon Almaren, and Melkor lurked beyond the
[Walls of Night](). During this time animals first appeared, and forests
started to grow.

The Spring of Arda was interrupted when Melkor returned to Arda, and ended
completely when he assaulted and destroyed the Lamps of the Valar.

Arda was again darkened, and the fall of the great Lamps spoiled the symmetry
of Arda's surface. New continents were created: [Aman]() in the West,
Middle-earth proper in the middle, the uninhabited lands (later called the
[Land of the Sun]()) in the East. At the site of the northern lamp was later
the inland [Sea of Helcar](), of which [Cuiviénen]() was a bay. At the site of
the southern lamp was later the [Sea of Ringil](). After the destruction of the
Two Lamps the Years of the Lamps ended and the Years of the Trees began.
