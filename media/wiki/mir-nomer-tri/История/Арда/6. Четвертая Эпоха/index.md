# Fourth Age

Main article: Fourth Age

The end of the Third Age marked the end of the involvement of the Elves in
Human affairs, despite a short-lived revival of Elven presence in Gondor under
Legolas. Most Elves that have lingered in Middle-earth leave for Valinor—those
that remain behind "fade", and eventually diminish. A similar fate happens to
the Dwarves: although Erebor becomes an ally of the Reunited Kingdom and there
are indications Khazad-dûm is refounded, and a colony is established under
Gimli in the White Mountains, they become ever more reclusive, and disappear
from human history. Morgoth's creatures are almost wiped out and never recover.
During the later Fourth Age the tales of the earlier Ages turn into legends,
until they are eventually thought of as fantasies, as the heirs of the
Númenóreans forget their heritage.
