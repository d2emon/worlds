The Star Trek canon is a complicated place. Within the TV show and movies alone, there are prequels, sequels, time travel and alternate universes to keep track of - and not all of them happen in the right order. Star Trek Discovery is the latest continuity insert (and a fine one at that) – but how does it relate to everything else?

We begin our look at Star Trek's timeline around 40 years into “our” future, at a point when the Earth is recovering from World War III…

## The Big Bang

*   Quinn hides in the big bang to avoid discovery by Q.

## Billions of years ago

### 16 billion years ago
*   The universe is formed in the instantaneous expansion that scientists called the "Big Bang". The "Big Bang" was theorized to be caused by destabilizing Omega molecules. (VOY: "The Omega Directive")
*   This point in time represents a hideout for members of the Q Continuum. The USS Voyager was briefly transported here by Quinn in order to escape Q, but he too had once used this hideout and was thus able to find the ship. (VOY: "Death Wish")

    The age of the universe was given in VOY: "Good Shepherd" as sixteen billion years, which was the estimated age during the filming of the episode. Current real-world scientific evidence indicates the age of the universe to be 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.

    According to an okudagram from TNG: "The Royale", showing data about planet Theta VIII, its age was "7.2×1010 solar years", i.e., 72 billion years old.

### 9 billion years ago

*   Hundreds of protostars collapsed in close proximity to one another forming the astronomical phenomenon later known as a black cluster. (TNG: "Hero Worship")

### c. 6 billion years ago

*   The Guardian of Forever is formed.[3]

### 5 billion years ago Edit

*   The star Sol begins to form out of nebular dust and interstellar gases. (VOY: "Death Wish")
*   Female Q is born. (VOY: "The Q and the Grey")

### 4.5 billion years ago

*   The Guardian of Forever was asked its last question until 2267, when it told Captain James T. Kirk and Spock that it had awaited a question "since before your sun burned hot in space." (TOS: "The City on the Edge of Forever")
*   The ancient humanoids, one of the oldest known sentient species, seeded the oceans of many worlds with DNA codes, directing the evolution of life towards a physical pattern similar to their own. The varieties of lifeforms that carried this seed code to fruition include the Humans, Vulcans, Klingons, and Cardassians, and likely many other humanoid species of the galaxy. (TNG: "The Chase")

### 4 billion years ago

*   Q and the female Q begin their romantic involvement around this time. (VOY: "The Q and the Grey")
*   The planet Pollux IV forms in the Beta Geminorum system. (TOS: "Who Mourns for Adonais?")
*   A humanoid civilization seeds the oceans of many planets with genetic material, which would lead to the development of humanoids on many planets.

### 3.5 billion years ago

*   On Earth, in a region later known as France, amino acids combine to form the first proteins. In an alternate timeline, an anti-time eruption prevents the formation of life, fulfilling Q's verdict for Humanity. (TNG: "All Good Things...")
*   According to current real-world science, there is evidence that suggests life took hold on Earth already between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years ago [1] and flourished in the oceans by at least 3.7 billion years ago. [2]

### 2 billion years ago

*   Civilization on Tagus III exists as of this time. According to Q, they "really knew how to party back in those days". (TNG: "Qpid")
*   It was not elaborated whether this civilization was already Taguan or some preceding species.

### 1 billion years ago

*   The Slaver Empire is the master of all intelligent beings in the Milky Way Galaxy. The Slavers and all of their subjects are exterminated in a massive war which caused all intelligent life to re-evolve. (TAS: "The Slaver Weapon")

## Millions of years ago

### 400 million years ago

*   In the Devonian period, Eryops, the last common ancestor of cold-blooded and warm-blooded organisms, lives on Earth. (VOY: "Distant Origin")
*   According to real-word science, Eryops lived some hundred million years later during the Permian period.

### 300 million years ago

*   An alien ship of an insectoid race is invaded by a magnetic organism. Trapped in orbit of Questar M-17, the crew destroys their own ship to prevent it being carried to other worlds. (TAS: "Beyond the Farthest Star")

### 87 million years ago

*   The D'Arsay civilization launches the archive of their culture. (TNG: "Masks")

### 65 million years ago

*   A mass extinction occurs at the end of the Cretaceous period on Earth when an asteroid impacts the planet, wiping out the dominant reptile superorder, the dinosaurs, among others. (VOY: "Distant Origin"; ENT: "Azati Prime")
*   According to the Distant Origin Theory, some of Earth's dinosaurs belonging to the hadrosaur genus survive the mass extinction. Although the dominant reptile superorder was almost wiped out, these surviving dinosaurs continue to develop, likely on a secluded, later destroyed landmass. Sometime thereafter, they possibly become one of the first interstellar species in the galaxy when they leave Earth and travel to the Delta Quadrant, laying the foundation for the Voth civilization. (VOY: "Distant Origin")

    While Dr. Forra Gegen suggests this hypothesis for the origin of the Voth, Chakotay later theorizes that the Voth's ancestors left before the extinction event, the impending catastrophe being what motivated them to do so in the first place.

*   65-100 millions years ago
    *   The dinosaurs (the Voth civilization) from the episode "Distant Origin" are most likely descendants of Hadrosaurids who lived in the Cretaceous period of Earth's history.

### 20 million years ago

*   Now considering themselves a race indigenous to the Delta Quadrant, the recorded history and identity of the Voth dates back to around this time. (VOY: "Distant Origin", "Friendship One")

### 5 million to 2.5 million years ago

*   The Pliocene epoch spans this time on Earth. Hanon IV had reached this level of geological evolution by the 24th century. (VOY: "Basics, Part I", "Basics, Part II")

### 1 million years ago

*   On Earth, the ancestors of Humans begin to distinguish themselves from their primate ancestors by their intelligence and reasoning skills. (TOS: "A Taste of Armageddon")
*   Construction of the vast city around the Guardian of Forever, stretching out to the horizon of its' planet. (TOS: "The City on the Edge of Forever")
*   Lactrans attain a level of development that would not be met in terms of Human development until the late 23rd century. (TAS: "The Eye of the Beholder")
*   Sargon's people explore the galaxy and colonize various planets, possibly including Vulcan.[

### Indeterminate

*   The inhabitants of Organia evolve to beings of pure energy. (TOS: "Errand of Mercy")

    Ayelborne said that his people had evolved beyond the need for physical bodies "millions of years ago."

## Hundreds of thousands of years ago

*   A Sphere-shaped lifeform that died in the mid-23rd century dates back to this era. It records everything it sees and experiences starting around this time as well, including data on countless civilizations (DIS: "Project Daedalus")
*   In "An Obol for Charon", initial scans suggest the sphere is only one hundred thousand years old, but this seems to have been revised to hundreds of thousands years by Project Daedalus.

### 600,000 years ago

*   The Tkon Empire collapses. (TNG: "The Last Outpost")
*   The humanoid ancestors of Sargon's species colonize the galaxy. Their colonists may have caused, or influenced, the rise of intelligent life on Vulcan. (TOS: "Return to Tomorrow")
*   The Tkon Empire, an interstellar state consisting of dozens of star systems in the Alpha Quadrant, becomes extinct.

### 500,000 years ago

*   Sargon's species is destroyed in a massive civil war when the atmosphere is ripped from their planet. Only a few survivors escape by preserving their consciousnesses in a cave deep below the surface. (TOS: "Return to Tomorrow")
*   Bajoran civilization begins to flourish. The ancient Bajorans are renowned for their accomplishments in science, mathematics, philosophy, and the arts long before Humans learn to speak or make tools. (TNG: "Ensign Ro")

    While the emergence of language among Humans cannot be exactly dated, Humanity had begun to use stone tools already 2.6 million years ago according to real-world science.

*   The planet Exo III becomes uninhabitable after its sun begins to go dark. The inhabitants resettle beneath the surface and construct androids to serve them. (TOS: "What Are Little Girls Made Of?")

    According to Star Trek: Star Charts, p. 34, the Talosians become warp-capable.

### 200,000 years ago

*   The Iconians, a highly developed civilization, are presumed destroyed in an orbital bombardment of their homeworld. (TNG: "Contagion"; DS9: "To the Death")
*   The large bioplasmic organism, later dubbed the "telepathic pitcher plant", is born in the Delta Quadrant. (VOY: "Bliss")
*   By at least this point, as according to Q, the Borg have begun their evolution into cybernetic beings. (TNG: "Q Who")

    Star Trek: Destiny presents a different point of origin for the Borg.

*   The Iconian civilization is destroyed.

### 100,000 years ago

*   The subspace network which will be later claimed by the Hirogen is constructed. (VOY: "Message in a Bottle", "Hunters")
*   The ocean planet, later home of the Monean civilization, is created by extracting all water from a class M planet and containing it inside an immense force field. (VOY: "Thirty Days")
*   In Africa on Earth, the /Xam Abathwa tribe gathers to share a story about a girl who created the milky way. In one later told version of the story, the girl belonged to a group of primitive farmers afraid of the night, until the girl encounted an alien. (DIS: "Brother"; ST: "The Girl Who Made the Stars")

## Tens of thousands of years ago

### 30,000 years ago

*   The Verathan civilization, originally from the Verath system in the Gamma Quadrant, reaches its height, spanning two dozen star systems. (DS9: "Q-Less")
*   An ancient city is built on Bajor with walls and a stone tablet. Trapped inside the tablet are two antagonistic non-corporeal lifeforms, a Pah-wraith and a Prophet. (DS9: "The Reckoning")

### 28,000 years ago

*   On Earth, the Neanderthals become extinct. (ENT: "Dear Doctor")

### 25,000 years ago

*   The stone tablet city in Bajor is abandoned, sediments bury the ruins, and eventually the ancient city of B'hala is built on top. (DS9: "The Reckoning")

### 22,000 years ago

*   The first of at least 947 archaeological expeditions is conducted at the ancient ruins on Tagus III. (TNG: "Qpid")

### 10,000 years ago

*   The machine-god Vaal on Gamma Trianguli VI is built. (TOS: "The Apple")
*   The civilization on Sigma Draconis VI, by this point at its technological peak, advanced well beyond 23rd century Federation capabilities, experiences a catastrophic glacial age. As a result, the inhabitants of the planet begin to de-evolve to a primitive level, and the male and female inhabitants experience a great schism in their society. (TOS: "Spock's Brain")
*   When their sun is about to go nova, the Fabrini leave their system on a propelled asteroid known as Yonada. (TOS: "For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky")
*   A species of intelligent spacefaring organisms which form symbiotic relationships with humanoid lifeforms that live within their bodies becomes nearly extinct. Gomtuu is the last known survivor. (TNG: "Tin Man")
*   The first of the Orbs is discovered by the Bajorans in the sky above their planet. Over the next ten millennia, a total of nine of these extraordinary objects are discovered, inspiring revelations that shape Bajoran religion. (DS9: "Emissary")
*   According to Quinn, this is the last time that "ordinary" Q in the Q Continuum have to speak with each other. (VOY: "Death Wish")
*   Bajoran archaeologists begin their unsuccessful search for the lost city of B'hala, which is not uncovered until the year 2373. (DS9: "Rapture")
*   A path on a Delta Quadrant planet was said to be cut out by unknown spacefarers. The path endured into the 24th century, when it was used by Mikhal Travelers who had an outpost on the planet. (VOY: "Darkling")

    In "The Dogs of War", Weyoun 8 euphorically claims that "the Dominion hasn't surrendered in battle since it was founded ten thousand years ago." This seems to contradict Weyoun 4 in "To the Death", who states "The Dominion has endured for two thousand years [...]."

    In DS9: "Little Green Men", Nog states that it "took [ten thousand years] to establish the Ferengi Alliance", which implies it dates back to 8000 BC or earlier. This might also imply that Gint, the first Grand Nagus and original author of the Rules of Acquisition lived at this time, if he is considered the founder of the Alliance.

### Indeterminate

## I

### Events

*   Circa 30
    *   On Kaminar, the number of Kelpiens that has not passed Vahar'ai drop to zero, and evolved Kelpiens almost drive the Ba'ul to extinction. The Ba'ul turn the situation around with measures preventing the existence of post-Vahar'ai Kelpiens, theorized to be helped by their technological advantage. A spherical lifeform records data on the planet in this era. (DIS: "The Sound of Thunder")
    
        Dialog established this era as around 2,300 years ago, but the computer display can be seen depicting a range of years spanning from at least 2,223 to 2,217 years ago. The exact time the Ba'ul population reaches its nadir can not be seen due to only parts of the screen being seen at a time, and likely is slightly before 2223.

*   Circa 85
    *   Parmen marries Philana. (TOS: "Plato's Stepchildren")

        In 2268, the 2,300-year-old Philana said she married Parmen when she was 117 years old.

A world ruled by emperors who can trace their line back 2000 years to their own Julius and Augustus Caesars".

    The non-canon novel The Galactic Whirlpool reference the first six emperors of ancient Rome : Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero.

*   Emergence of the Christian religion after the presumed life of Jesus Christ (c. 4 BC - c. 33).

    Undated event.

    He appears on many works of art including:
    *   the painting Annunciation (VOY: "Scorpion", "Scientific Method", "Concerning Flight", "The Raven")
    *   the painting Adoration of the Magi (VOY: "Concerning Flight")
    *   the painting The Virgin and Child with St. Anne (VOY: "Scorpion", "The Raven", "Scientific Method", "Concerning Flight".)

## III

### Events

*   Spock's ancestors adopt a ceremonial ground that remains in their family at least until the 23rd century. (TOS: "Amok Time")
*   The society on planet 892-IV evolves on a path similar to that of Earth's Roman Empire, in an example of Hodgkin's Law of Parallel Planetary Development. (TOS: "Bread and Circuses")

*   The Dominion may have been founded in the Gamma Quadrant by the shapeshifting race known as the Changelings (founders) around this time.

### Background information

*   In "The Dogs of War", Weyoun 8 euphorically claims that "the Dominion hasn't surrendered in battle since it was founded ten thousand years ago." This seems to contradict Weyoun 4 in "To the Death", who states "The Dominion has endured for two thousand years [...]." That number seems to align with the Female Changeling, who commented that the Jem'Hadar had been the Dominion's first line of defense for two thousand years in "What You Leave Behind".

*   Lines from "Rightful Heir" and DS9: "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places" indicate that the time of Kahless was "a thousand years ago", i.e., apparently implying the 14th century. However, "Rightful Heir" mentions the monks on Boreth had been awaiting Kahless' return for "fifteen centuries", i.e. five hundred years longer. This would also be in accord with the Sword of Kahless being dated to an age of 1,400 years in "The Sword of Kahless". Furthermore, a scene cut from "Rightful Heir" had Data specify Kahless' death as 1,547 years ago, which would place it in 822 AD.

In 2367, an interstellar con artist deceived the Ventaxians into believing she was the deity in order to reclaim this prize. If the Ventaxian year is close to the Earth year, the beginning of this new era on Ventax II would be set in the 14th century.

## XXIII

The 23rd century, defined in the calendar of Earth as being from 2201 until 2300, was a period of expansion for the United Federation of Planets, with Humans and other founding species, such as Vulcans, at the forefront of exploration. The Federation's exploration agency Starfleet would make first contact with numerous intelligent species and civilizations, including the Talosians, the First Federation, the Gorn Hegemony. the Metrons, the Horta, and the Excalbians. The long-running conflict with the Klingon Empire, begun in the 22nd century, was a major topic of this century's history, as was the rekindling of tensions with the Romulan Star Empire. Of particular note are the voyages of the starship Enterprise and the careers of its long-serving command staff under James T. Kirk.

*   2200s
*   2210s
    *   A mining colony is established on the planet Janus VI, which soon becomes the Federation's key source of pergium and other rare ores. Unknown to the colonists, the planet is actually the homeworld of the Horta species. (TOS: "The Devil in the Dark")
    *   The Zeon people establish a colony on the nearby planet Ekos. A half a century later, this colony is wiped out virtually overnight by a genocide purge ordered by John Gill who was then under the influence of his deputy Melakon. (TOS: "Patterns of Force")

        Listening closely to Gill's speech in "Patterns of Force", one can hear him say "the Zeon Colony has existed for nearly half a century", meaning that it was established sometime after 2218.

    *   2210 – Amanda Grayson, Spock’s mother, is born on Earth.
*   2220s
    *   Relations between between the Federation and the Klingon Empire become hostile. (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country)

        Spock refers to "almost seventy years of unremitting hostilities", suggesting a date around 2223 but not quite that year. However, a timeline seen in "In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II" specified that year exactly.

    *   Simon Van Gelder is born. (TOS: "Dagger of the Mind")
    *   2222
        *   Montgomery Scott is born in Scotland.
    *   2226
        *   Michael Burnham is born on Earth.
    *   2227
        *   Leonard McCoy is born in Georgia, North America on Earth.
*   2230s
    *   Stardate 1087.7
        *   Gary Mitchell is born. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before")

            Presumably, Mitchell was younger than James Kirk (born 2233), since Kirk was an instructor of Mitchell's. The two men did not seem to be different enough in age to suggest Mitchell might have been born in the 2240s.

    *   Stardate 1089.5
        *   Elizabeth Dehner is born. (TOS: "Where No Man Has Gone Before")

            Presumably, Dehner's stardate of birth being only a few digits from Mitchell's indicates the same time period.

    *   2230 – Spock is born. Amanda Grayson is 20 and Sarek is 65. Problematic tbh.
        *   Spock, the son of Sarek and the human Amanda Grayson, is born on Vulcan.
        *   Hikaru Sulu is born in San Francisco, North America on Earth.
    *   2233 – James T. Kirk is born. Just for context, in the divergent timeline of the reboot movies the Romulan terrorist Nero arrives from the future on the Narada, destroys the USS Kelvin and kills George Kirk. Everything after this point doesn’t apply to the reboot timeline, but… that’s a separate article.

*   2240s
    *   The 2240s were an important decade for Federation space exploration, with the commissioning of new starship class vessels Constitution and Enterprise, which came to be known as Constitution-class starships. Captained by Robert T. April, with wife Sarah April as CMO, Enterprise experienced many exploration firsts in her long career, which began in 2245. These new ships benefited from advances in warp drive which came along with the breaking of the time barrier, and also new computer advancements such as duotronics, invented by Richard Daystrom in this decade.
    *   The PXK pergium-powered nuclear reactor goes out of common use. One notable exception is the Janus VI colony. (TOS: "The Devil in the Dark")
    *   The decade also included one of the worst crimes in Federation history when four thousand colonists at Tarsus IV are put to death at the orders of Governor Kodos. (TOS: "The Conscience of the King")

        *   Pavel Chekov is born to Russian parents.[39] In the alternate timeline created by Nero's attack on the USS Kelvin, Chekov is only eight years younger than James T. Kirk, implying a birthdate of 2241.[
    *   2245-2250
        *   The USS Enterprise, a Constitution class vessel is launched under the command of Robert April, on a five-year mission of exploration.[1] In the alternate timeline created by Nero's attack on the USS Kelvin, the Enterprise is still under construction in 2255 and is not launched on her maiden voyage until 2258.
*   2250s
    *   The 2250s saw Starfleet and the Federation face a significant threat, as the maneuverings of the Klingon T'Kuvma led to the rallying of the Klingon Great Houses and the Federation-Klingon War.

    *   Pardek becomes a member of the Romulan Senate. (TNG: "Unification I")
    *   Contact with the SS Artemis is lost on stardate 7780.85, and the ship eventually crash-lands on Tau Cygna V. Two thirds of the crew died of hyperonic radiation before the survivors manage to establish a colony, that by 2366 was thriving. (TNG: "The Ensigns of Command")

        The year of these events was not outright stated, but the launch is said to have taken place ninety-two years before the episode. Since the survivors claimed to have been on the planet for over ninety years, the ship crashed sometime in or after 2274 but before the end of 2276.

Star Trek V would then take place in early 2287, with the events of Star Trek IV spanning most of 2286, with several months passing after Kirk's return to the future to account for the preparation of the Enterprise-A and Gillian's training for her space assignment.)
*   2290s
    *   The year 2293 was particularly significant in this decade, as it marked the ending of hostilities between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire, despite attempted thwarting by a conspiracy to disrupt the peace negotiations at Camp Khitomer. Additionally, the crew of the USS Enterprise-A were retired following the signing of the Khitomer Accords, along with the Enterprise-A herself. Captain James T. Kirk was presumed killed in this year during the maiden voyage of the USS Enterprise-B. (Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country; Star Trek Generations)

    *   Following the explosion of the Klingon moon Praxis, the Federation and the Klingon Empire begin negotiations for ending nearly seventy years of hostilities between the two governments. Chancellor Gorkon of the Klingon High Council is assassinated en route to Earth, threatening the peace initiative. An investigation by the crew of the Enterprise-A reveals a conspiracy to stop the peace process, and subsequently manages to arrest the conspirators, allowing the Khitomer Accords to be signed in 2293.

## XXIV

The 24th century, defined in the calendar of Earth as being from 2301 until 2400, was a period of great conflict and political upheaval between the various races and organizations of the Milky Way Galaxy. In the latter half, the Federation makes contact with several new species and civilizations, including powerful new races such as the Q, and other lesser races such as: the Ferengi, the Dominion, and the Borg, the latter two of whom attack the Federation on several occasions. The Romulan Star Empire enters a second period of isolation, lasting approximately fifty years, from which they emerge far stronger than ever before. The Borg attempt to assimilate Earth twice, first in 2366 and again in 2373. The latter year also sees the beginning of the Dominion War, which ends in 2375, with several of the major powers of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants joining together to defeat the Dominion.

In addition, the Federation makes its first explorations of the Delta and Gamma Quadrants during the latter half of this century. Also, in 2387, the Romulan system is destroyed by a supernova which, due to the actions of Ambassador Spock and Nero, ultimately leads to the creation of an alternate reality.

*   Some time after 2387(2399): *Star Trek: Picard*
    *   The producers of the eagerly-awaited untitled Picard series have explained that the destruction of Romulus and dissolution of the Romulan empire will be a springboard for some of the events in this TV show, in which Picard has (likely) left Starfleet behind for good.

    *   2354-2381
        *   New Frontier
    *   2355
        *   Magnus, Erin, and Annika Hansen are assimilated by the Borg while on a research mission in the Delta quadrant.

    *   The United Federation of Planets continued with deep space exploration missions throughout the early portions of the decade; however, first contact with the Borg and the re-emergence of the Romulan Star Empire after a fifty-year period of isolation began to show the need for more combat-oriented ships and personnel training. The Borg threat encouraged Starfleet to develop the Defiant-class starship, the Federation's first unofficial warship. (Star Trek: The Next Generation; DS9: "The Search, Part I")
    *   The Romulan Empire made several attempts to destabilize the alliance between the Federation and the Klingon Empire in this decade. With the onset of the Klingon Civil War in late 2367, the Romulans began providing material support to the House of Duras, a move which would have assured victory for the forces of Duras and ultimately lead to the dissolution of the Federation-Klingon alliance. In the end, the Federation exposed the Romulan connection to the Duras family and the war ended in favor of Chancellor Gowron, leaving the Federation-Klingon alliance intact. (TNG: "Redemption", "Redemption II")
    *   Despite the sharp increase of hostilities in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants throughout the decade, space exploration was still a high priority for the Federation. The Bajoran wormhole was discovered in 2369 and provided a direct link between the Alpha and Gamma Quadrants. Unfortunately, this wormhole led to first contact with the Dominion in 2370, and paved the way for one of the bloodiest conflicts in Federation history. (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)
    *   Nova Squadron wins the Rigel Cup. The victory celebration is described by Boothby as a near-riot. (TNG: "The First Duty")
    *   The Romulan Empire ends a fifty-year period of isolation and begins taking a more active role in Alpha Quadrant politics. (TNG: "The Neutral Zone")
    *   The Federation makes several first contacts in this decade, the most notable being with the Q Continuum in 2364 and the Borg Collective in 2365. (TNG: "Encounter at Farpoint", "Q Who")
    *   The Battle of Wolf 359 is fought in 2367, leading to the destruction of 39 starships and the loss of 11,000 lives. (TNG: "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II", "The Drumhead")
    *   The Federation and the Cardassian Union sign the Federation-Cardassian Armistice of 2367, putting an end to hostilities during the Federation-Cardassian War. The Federation-Cardassian Treaty was signed in 2370. (TNG: "The Wounded", "Journey's End")
    *   The Klingon Empire fights the Klingon Civil War from 2367-2368. Chancellor Gowron's forces are victorious after the House of Duras is exposed accepting assistance from the Romulan Star Empire.
    *   The Cardassian Union withdraws from the planet Bajor in 2369, ending the fifty year Occupation of Bajor. At the request of the new Bajoran Provisional Government, the Federation establishes a presence in the Bajoran system. Starfleet and the Bajoran Militia take joint control of Deep Space 9 (formerly Terok Nor). The Bajoran wormhole is discovered a short time later by Commander Benjamin Sisko and Lieutenant Jadzia Dax, opening the door for exploration of the distant Gamma Quadrant. Deep Space 9 is moved from its orbit around Bajor to a point near the wormhole. (DS9: "Emissary")
    *   A couple of Ferengi attempt to break into Fort Knox on Earth. (VOY: "Dark Frontier")
    *   The first six seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation take place in this decade. Additionally, the first season of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine takes place in 2369, overlapping with The Next Generation.
    *   2363
        *   USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D), the third Galaxy class starship (Following the Galaxy and Yamato) is launched from the Utopia Planitia shipyards in Mars orbit (under the command of Jean-Luc Picard), and becomes the Federation's new flagship.
    *   2364: A subtle attempt by parasitic beings to take full control of Starfleet and to prepare for an all-out invasion of the Federation is discovered and thwarted. (TNG: "Coming of Age", "Conspiracy", "The Drumhead")

    *   2367: After making first contact with the Borg in 2365, a Borg cube attacks the Federation but is destroyed in Earth orbit after the Battle of Wolf 359. Later that year, Klingon Chancellor K'mpec is killed and succeeded by Gowron. His position is quickly challenged but eventually affirmed in the brief Klingon Civil War against the Romulan-influenced, but ultimately inferior, House of Duras. (TNG: "The Neutral Zone", "Q Who", "The Best of Both Worlds", "Reunion", "Redemption")
        *   The Next Generation S04
        *   The Borg assimilate Captain Jean-Luc Picard – the Battle of Wolf 359 is fought 7.7 light years from Earth in Sector 001. The battle results in the loss of 39 Starfleet vessels and over 11,000 lives. Benjamin Sisko aboard the USS Saratoga was a participant in the battle and was one of the few survivors alongside his son Jake Sisko. With the task force lost, the Borg continue to Earth. Picard is rescued and the Borg cube is destroyed via the actions of the crew of the Enterprise-D.

        *   The events of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.
*   2370s
    *   In this decade, the United Federation of Planets continued their exploration of the Gamma Quadrant by way of the Bajoran wormhole, discovered in 2369. By the end of 2370, the powers of the Alpha Quadrant had been forced into a cold war with the Dominion, a major political entity in the Gamma Quadrant, that continued until 2373. This cold war degenerated into open hostilities by the end of that year, and continued until 2375. The war turned out to be one of the bloodiest interstellar conflicts in galactic history, leaving the Klingon Empire set back by nearly a decade and over eight hundred million Cardassian civilians slaughtered at the hands of their former Dominion allies during the final battle of the conflict. (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)
    *   Hostilities with the Borg Collective were also a major concern throughout the decade. A second attempt to assimilate Earth in 2373 left Starfleet forces stretched thin for months, a fact that was a source of concern prior to the Dominion's invasion of the Alpha Quadrant later that year. (Star Trek: First Contact; DS9: "In Purgatory's Shadow")
    *   Additionally, the Federation inadvertently began its first exploration of the Delta Quadrant in 2371, when the USS Voyager was transported there by an entity called the Caretaker. In addition to collecting a multitude of data on the region that would keep Federation scientists occupied for decades, Captain Kathryn Janeway and her crew made more first contacts with alien species since the era of James T. Kirk and the original USS Enterprise. On the final leg of their journey, the Voyager crew managed to deal near-catastrophic damage to the Borg; however, it remains unknown if the Borg were able to recover. (Star Trek: Voyager)

    *   The time ship Relativity, under the command of Captain Braxton, uses its temporal sensors to scan the USS Voyager in 2375 and finds a temporal explosion during that period. The crew recruits Seven of Nine three times to find out how, where, and by whom the explosive device was planted. When Braxton himself is revealed to be the saboteur, Captain Kathryn Janeway is sent back in time to apprehend him just as he arrives on board. Seven and Janeway are returned to their time frame and the three Braxtons, one from the ship, one from when he was planting the device, and the one from when he arrived to activate the device, are reintegrated and later stand trial. (VOY: "Relativity")

        Going by Data's statement that the energy ribbon from Star Trek Generations passes through the Milky Way Galaxy every 39.1 years, it can be expected to return in 2800, 2839, and 2878.

## XXXI

*   VOY: "Living Witness"[4]

### Events

*   The main plot of the Star Trek: Voyager episode "Living Witness" takes place sometime around 3074, and the final scene takes place "many years" after that.
*   Episodes with time traveler Daniels from Enterprise
    *   "Cold Front", "Shockwave", "Azati Prime"
*   Daniels is born. By this time, time travel is so commonplace that there are quantum discriminators in every high school desk. (ENT: "Shockwave, Part II")
*   3052 (circa)
    *   Daniels, fearing a change in the timeline, transports Jonathan Archer to this time, causing a catastrophic timeline change that wipes out his entire civilization. Returning Archer to 2152 remedies the problem. (ENT: "Shockwave", "Shockwave, Part II")
*   3052 (circa)
    *   An Earth vessel travels back to the 22nd century, where it apparently suffers some sort of critical disaster. The pilot is killed in the accident and the pod itself is heavily damaged. It is eventually discovered by the Enterprise NX-01 in October of 2152, and Enterprise's chief engineer Commander Charles Tucker is able to reactivate the pod's temporal beacon. Within seconds, the pod, the dead pilot, and the beacon itself all vanish, having presumably being retrieved by operatives from the 31st century. (ENT: "Future Tense")
*   3070 (circa)
    *   Captain Jean-Luc Picard estimated that the core of Atrea IV would remain molten until this time. (TNG: "Inheritance")
*   3074 (circa)
    *   In the Delta Quadrant, a Kyrian historian named Quarren discovers a backup copy of The Doctor. After he is reactivated, The Doctor corrects the distorted view of USS Voyager in Kyrian history and precipitates a new harmony between the Kyrian and Vaskan races. After many years as Kyrian Surgical Chancellor, this copy of The Doctor boards a ship and heads for the Alpha Quadrant to find out what happened to Voyager and his fellow crewmates. (VOY: "Living Witness")
*   3080 (circa)
    *   Quarren dies. (VOY: "Living Witness")

### Background information

*   Kyrians obviously have had no contact with the Federation between their encounter with Voyager in 2374 and this time, despite claims by Q that the Federation will have a presence in the Delta Quadrant as soon as the late 25th century as per VOY: "Death Wish".
*   Going by Data's statement that the energy ribbon from Star Trek Generations passes through the Milky Way Galaxy every 39.1 years, it could be expected to return in 3034 and 3073.
*   The undeveloped series Star Trek: Federation would have taken place in this century.

### 31st century productions

*   VOY: "Living Witness"
*   ENT: "Shockwave" (in part)
*   ENT: "Shockwave, Part II" (in part)

## XXXII

### Events

*   3125
    *   A retrofitted dorsal carrier, design XRT-55D, is commissioned. (ENT: "Future Tense")

        This date appeared in the database of temporal agent Daniels. Seeing as he came from the 31st century, this information would be from his own future.

*   3186
    *   Dr. Gabrielle Burnham, mother of Michael Burnham, is transported to this year from 2236 by the Project Daedalus suit after escaping from the Klingon attack on Doctari Alpha, and finds the galaxy lifeless. After this, she finds she is repeatedly pulled back to this era, which acts as an anchor point for her. (DIS: "Perpetual Infinity")

        This date is derived by adding to 2236 the 950 years Burnham was said to have traveled in the future.

    *   This is the year Gabrielle Burnham arrived in after using the Red Angel suit to escape a Klingon attack on her home. (Discovery S2 E10)
    *   This is the same year Star Trek: Discovery season 3 will be set.[52]
*   3187
    *   The USS Discovery travels to this year from the year 2257. (DIS: "Such Sweet Sorrow, Part 2")

## XXXIII

*   Star Trek: Short Treks episode "Calypso" takes place sometime during this century. By Star Trek's fictional chronology, this is the last episode of all the seven series.
*   Sometimes around 3256: Short Treks' "Calypso"
    *   As someone pointed out in our comment section, one of Discovery's latest Short Treks, "Calypso," takes place roughly 1,000 years following the events of Discovery, catching up with the abandoned ship's computer, Zora. This potentially concerning peak into the Federation's future has yet to be addressed in Discovery.

### Events

*   Sometime in the millennium preceding this century, Alcor IV is colonized by Humans. (ST: "Calypso")
*   A war involving the natives of Alcor IV and the V'draysh takes place that lasts at least ten years. Craft is a soldier involved in this conflict, and leaves his family behind to fight the V'draysh. (ST: "Calypso")
*   About ten years into the war, Craft steals an enemy escape pod and finds himself drifting through space for about a month. (ST: "Calypso")
*   USS Discovery lies abandoned in a region of space with lightning-like phenomena, having been abandoned for an unspecified period of time, nearly a millennium after its time period of origin. Craft, still in the V'draysh escape pod, is brought aboard by the ship's artificial intelligence, but at some point thereafter departs for his homeworld, Alcor IV, which is remote but within reach of Discovery's last shuttle. (ST: "Calypso")
*   3267
    *   Around this year, Captain James T. Kirk reckoned that Humanity would be able to prove that there is hope for themselves; based on a conversation he had with a Metron. (TOS: "Arena")
*   3269
    *   After placing the Enterprise in suspended animation, Flint remarked that he may release the ship in this year. (TOS: "Requiem for Methuselah")

### Background information

*   This is the latest confirmed time period depicted in Star Trek canon. The final scene of "Living Witness" was set "many years" after 3074, but was not further specified.

##33rd century productions

*   ST: "Calypso"

## Far future

### Events

*   A neutron star in a binary star system in the Kavis Alpha sector will continue to explode into the far future every 196 years. (TNG: "Evolution")
*   The Lactrans estimate that Starfleet will be welcome back to Lactra VII in twenty or thirty Lactran centuries. (TAS: "The Eye of the Beholder")
*   The Nexus passes through the Milky Way Galaxy every 39.1 years. (Star Trek Generations)

#### 34th century

*   3374
    *   According to Obrist, if the Krenim weapon ship continued to alter time to this point, full restoration of the Krenim Imperium would not have been achieved. (VOY: "Year of Hell")
*   3374
    *   According to Karr, no one would remember the name "Hirogen" by this point had their culture continued to stagnate. (VOY: "The Killing Game")

#### 38th century

*   3774 (circa)
    *   According to Quarren, peace between the Kyrians and the Vaskans would not have been achieved until this time had The Doctor not shown the truth of their history. (VOY: "Living Witness")

#### 43rd century

*   4269
    *   When Flint placed the USS Enterprise in suspended animation, he stated he would possibly release it in two thousand years (after suggesting a shorter time period of one thousand years) and that James T. Kirk would know the future. (TOS: "Requiem for Methuselah")

#### 72nd century

*   7154 (circa)
    *   The Organians believed in 2154 that they would re-encounter Humans around this time. (ENT: "Observer Effect")

#### 123rd century

*   12267
    *   According to Kor, the Federation-Klingon War of 2267 would decide the fate of the Milky Way Galaxy for the following ten thousand years. (TOS: "Errand of Mercy")
*   12268
    *   Radiation levels in the Andromeda Galaxy are expected to reach intolerably high levels, according to scientists of the Kelvan Empire. (TOS: "By Any Other Name")

#### 523rd century

*   52267
    *   The Horta born on Janus VI in 2267 are expected to all die, except for one, who would care for the eggs she had laid. (TOS: "The Devil in the Dark")

#### + 500,000 years

*   The androids of planet Mudd are expected to cease functioning. (TOS: "I, Mudd")

#### + Two million years

*   An emerging star system, for whose formation Nella Daren attempted to construct a mathematical model during the 24th century, will complete its formation. (TNG: "Lessons")

#### + One billion years

*   According to Cosimo in an alternate 2372, a time stream could have sent Harry Kim to this time, had his attempt to restore history failed. (VOY: "Non Sequitur")

#### + 60-70 trillion years

*   According to the genetically-engineered Human Jack's predictions, the universe will collapse. (DS9: "Chrysalis")

This, broadly, is where established canon ends. Further glimpses in the future (such as the future timeline seen in TNG finale, "All Good Things) can only be considered potential futures.
