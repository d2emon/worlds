# 24 век

*   2300-е
    *   American Express ceases to exist.
    *   By the year 3000, "getting twenty-fourth century" is a slang term
        similar to "getting medieval," implying that the 24th century was a
        notably primitive and/or violent era, at least by 31st century
        standards.
*   2308
    *   The Nobel Peace prizes for the union between West and East Coast
        rappers is given, but then stolen by Bender who comes back in time.
    *   At least Stockholm and New York (but presumably the rest of Earth)
        are destroyed by Bender. This is the first destruction of Earth while
        Fry was frozen. Later, perhaps in a different year, New York begins to
        rebuild itself as a medieval like society, but it gets destroyed again,
        probably also by Bender. Again later, New New York is built. Previous
        versions of Fry, Bender and the Professor watch all of this.
