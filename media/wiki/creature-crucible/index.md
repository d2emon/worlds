Top Ballista is a Creature Crucible supplement and campaign setting that
describes Serraine, city of the magical biplane-flying skygnomes. The
supplement includes rules for player characters (PCs) for races such as
skygnomes, gremlins, pegataurs, and harpies, as well as new air-combat rules.

The aerial city of Serraine flies over the Known World carrying its skygnome
inhabitants, creators of bizarre yet workable inventions. The book describes
the flying aces of the Top Ballista squadrons, gnomes who pilot flying
machines, World War I style fighter planes, equipped with lightning guns and
synchronized crossbows. Creatures featured in the product, all living in
Serraine, are faenare (birdmen able to create spell-like effects through
songs), gnomes, gremlins, harpies, nagpa (vulture-headed humanoids), pegataurs
(winged centaurs), sphinxes, and tabi (catlike creatures). Each of these races
is introduced by a character who describes their cultures, evolution, and
lifestyles. Some creatures start with negative experience points totals when
used as PCs.

There are three adventures for characters of various experience point levels.
The first contains a basilisk that must be defeated by the PCs. The longest
adventure is for characters of levels 7â€“11, and is set within the flying city.
The opening stages require a fair bit of detective work from the PCs, and
after the investigation in the city, the PCs chase the villain through the air
in one of the planes.
