Thunder Rift is a setting created in the 1990s for the "basic" D&D product
line. The setting, an alternative to the Known World/Mystara (the standard D&D
setting), was conceived as a starting point for beginning game groups and to
be gradually expanded by the DM. The Thunder Rift worked as a self-contained
setting, but could be inserted in any existing game world as well.
