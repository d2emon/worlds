Eberron is a campaign setting for the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) role-playing
game, set in a period after a vast destructive war on the continent of
Khorvaire. Eberron is designed to accommodate traditional D&D elements and
races within a differently toned setting; Eberron combines a fantasy tone with
pulp and dark adventure elements, and some non-traditional fantasy
technologies such as trains, skyships, and mechanical beings which are all
powered by magic.

Eberron was created by author and game designer Keith Baker as the winning
entry for Wizards of the Coast's Fantasy Setting Search, a competition run in
2002 to establish a new setting for the D&D game. Eberron was chosen from more
than 11,000 entries, and was officially released with the publication of the
Eberron Campaign Setting hardback book in June 2004. The campaign setting book
was written by Baker, Bill Slavicsek, and James Wyatt.

In June 2005, the Eberron Campaign Setting book won the Origins Award for Best
Roleplaying Game Supplement of 2004.

A new version of the Campaign Setting was released in June and July 2009 to
bring the setting to the new 4th edition of D&D. Released were a Player's
Guide, a Campaign Guide, and an Adventure. In February 2015, an update for the
5th edition was released.
