Adult Swim's Rick and Morty is huge. The scope of this cartoon is so large, it's hard to even quantify. While most cartoons take place within a fairly reasonable space say, New York City, the houses and backyards of the suburbs, or even a pineapple under the sea, Rick and Morty expands well beyond that. It goes farther and stretches beyond of the far-reaching sci-fi universe of Futurama or the sprawling Springfield of The Simpsons.

The show does this by having an infinite number of timelines, in an infinite number of dimensions while visiting an infinite number of universes. Sound confusing? Don't worry, they switch the home base timeline halfway through the first season, so there is no standard. To top that off, the timeline goes both ways backwards and forward through time in this dimension or any other in the endless multiverse. Sounds crazy to try and keep track of all of these universes doesn't it?

We did it anyway. With this is list of every Rick and Morty universe (so far), you can quantify the unquantifiable and rank the many, many worlds, dimensions, and mini-verses featured on Rick and Morty. Vote up your favorite universes and be sure to wubba lubba dub dub!
