Mystara (рус. Мистара) — сеттинг для Dungeons & Dragons, издававшийся TSR,
Inc. в 1980—1995 годах. В настоящее время официально не поддерживается. Авторы
сеттинга — Дэвид Кук, Франк Менцер, Брюс Хард, Аарон Оллстон и другие.

Название «Мистара» происходит, вероятно, от английского «Mystery» — «тайна».

A campaign setting that evolved from the B and X series modules. Unlike other
settings, Mystara had ascended immortal beings instead of gods. This was the
default campaign world for the non-Advanced editions of D&D throughout the
1980s and 1990s, and the Blackmoor setting was later retconned to exist in
Mystara's distant past. Similarly to Forgotten Realms, it was also designed as
a "generic" high fantasy setting with a lot of variety, although arguably
lighter in tone and aimed at younger players.

Most adventures take place in "The Known World", a central continent that
includes a varied patchwork of both human and non-human realms: analogues of
Medieval Europe and Asian countries, Elvish and Dwarvish kingdoms, a pastoral
halfling realm, a region inhabited by tribes reminiscent of Native-American
peoples, a wasteland populated by orcs and other humanoid races, pirate
islands, and two large empires (one inspired by real-world Rome and the other
one ruled by powerful wizards). The setting includes further oddities, such as
the Savage Coast campaign and a peculiar underworld sub-setting (the Hollow
World).

During the 1990s, gamers' attention shifted towards the advanced edition of
D&D and its official campaigns (such as Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, Ravenloft
and Planescape). Eventually, the Mystara setting was abandoned - after some
publications surfaced during the 2000s in order to update it for the game's
3rd edition, official support for the campaign was discontinued. However, the
5th edition of D&D, launched in 2014, mentions Mystara again as a possible
setting for the game.
