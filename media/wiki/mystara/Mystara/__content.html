Mystara (рус. Мистара) — сеттинг для Dungeons & Dragons, издававшийся TSR, Inc. в 1980—1995 годах. В настоящее время официально не поддерживается. Авторы сеттинга — Дэвид Кук, Франк Менцер, Брюс Хард, Аарон Оллстон и другие.<br/>
<br/>
Название «Мистара» происходит, вероятно, от английского «Mystery» — «тайна».<br/>
<br/>
A campaign setting that evolved from the B and X series modules. Unlike other settings, Mystara had ascended immortal beings instead of gods. This was the default campaign world for the non-Advanced editions of D&D throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and the Blackmoor setting was later retconned to exist in Mystara's distant past. Similarly to Forgotten Realms, it was also designed as a "generic" high fantasy setting with a lot of variety, although arguably lighter in tone and aimed at younger players.<br/>
<br/>
Most adventures take place in "The Known World", a central continent that includes a varied patchwork of both human and non-human realms: analogues of Medieval Europe and Asian countries, Elvish and Dwarvish kingdoms, a pastoral halfling realm, a region inhabited by tribes reminiscent of Native-American peoples, a wasteland populated by orcs and other humanoid races, pirate islands, and two large empires (one inspired by real-world Rome and the other one ruled by powerful wizards). The setting includes further oddities, such as the Savage Coast campaign and a peculiar underworld sub-setting (the Hollow World).<br/>
<br/>
During the 1990s, gamers' attention shifted towards the advanced edition of D&D and its official campaigns (such as Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, Ravenloft and Planescape). Eventually, the Mystara setting was abandoned - after some publications surfaced during the 2000s in order to update it for the game's 3rd edition, official support for the campaign was discontinued. However, the 5th edition of D&D, launched in 2014, mentions Mystara again as a possible setting for the game.<br/>
