Pelinore is a lesser-known D&D campaign setting that was developed by TSR's UK
offices in its Imagine magazine.

Pelinore articles primarily focused on a major urban center, the City League,
and the surrounding county. Articles in Imagine detailed small locations
within the City League that could also be used in any setting, as they were
almost generic in execution.

Imagine presented a slice of this campaign world with each new issue from
issue 16, up until its cancellation at issue 30. NPCs were usually numbered
with a small printing of their ability statistics and a key number. If a
building had code number 25, people within would for instance be 25A onwards.

After the demise of Imagine the former assistant editor, Paul Cockburn,
created Game Master Publications. This series of unofficial D&D modules was
set in Pelinore with newly drawn maps and some renamed locations (e.g., the
"County of Cerwyn" became "Caerns"). Some modules described places beyond the
boundaries of the established setting. From issue GM4 onwards Game Master
Publications returned to the use of the original names and even reprinted the
official maps from Imagine. Game Master Publications was cancelled at issue
GM5 in 1987. This campaign setting is no longer officially supported.
